# unjournaldata

This is the repository for
[Unjournal](https://www.unjournal.org) evaluations, meta-analysis, and meta-science.

Outputs and reports from here are published at <https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata>.


# How it works

Data is currently imported from Airtable. 

The github site is created as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) book. There are also [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co) apps at
<https://unjournal.shinyapps.io/DataExplorer/> and <https://unjournal.shinyapps.io/uj-dashboard>.

The github site and dashboard are automatically rendered on github when you push to the `main` branch.

Publicly available data is inside the `/data` folder. This is also auto-updated
via github actions.
