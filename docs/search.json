    "text": "Preface\nThe Unjournal coordinates the public evaluation of hosted papers and dynamically-presented research projects. We are working independently of traditional academic journals to build an open platform and a sustainable system for feedback, ratings, and assessment. Our initial focus is quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in economics, policy, and other social sciences. We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work. Our aim: to make rigorous research more impactful, and impactful research more rigorous.\nOur main web site, unjournal.org, explains and presents our vision, procedures, and our progress. The ‘output’ evaluations and author (including feedback and discussion) can be found on our PubPub page, and are indexed in scholarly archives.\nThe present site presents data and analysis on The Unjournal’s pipeline and evaluation output\nIn large part:\nWe may expand this analysis further in the future, e.g., to include\nThis resource aims to be:\n10 Aug 2023: David Reinstein and Julia Bottesini have done most of the analysis here."

Moreover, the majority of methods outperform the usual benchmarks provided by the simple average or the median of estimates.\n\nHanea et al, 2021\nHowever, these are in a different context. Most of those measures are designed to deal with probablistic forecasts for binary outcomes, where the predictor also gives a ‘lower bound’ and ‘upper bound’ for that probability. We could roughly compare that to our continuous metrics with 90% CI’s (or imputations for these).\nFurthermore, many (all their successful measures?) use ‘performance-based weights’, accessing metrics from prior prediction performance of the same forecasters. We do not have these, nor do we have a sensible proxy for this.

By letting experts specify their knowledge in the form of a probability distribution, we can assess how accurately they can predict new data, and how appropriate their level of (un)certainty is. The expert’s specified probability distribution can be seen as a prior in a Bayesian statistical setting. We evaluate these priors by extending an existing prior-data (dis)agreement measure, the Data Agreement Criterion, and compare this approach to using Bayes factors to assess prior specification. We compare experts with each other and the data to evaluate their appropriateness. Using this method, new research questions can be asked and answered, for instance: Which expert predicts the new data best? Is there agreement between my experts and the data? Which experts’ representation is more valid or useful? Can we reach convergence between expert judgement and data?

    "text": "4.2 Inter-rater reliability\nInter-rater reliability is a measure of the degree to which two or more independent raters (in our case, paper evaluators) agree. Here, the ratings are the 7 aspects of each paper that evaluators were asked to rate. For each paper, we can obtain one value that summarizes the agreement between the two or three evaluators. Values closer to 1 indicate evaluators seem to agree on what score to attribute to a given paper across categories, while values close to zero indicate raters do not agree, and negative values indicate that raters have opposing opinions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about why we used Krippendorf’s alpha, and how to interpret it\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use Krippendorff’s alpha as a measure of interrater agreement. Krippendorff’s alpha is a more flexible measure of agreement and can be used with different levels of data (categorical, ordinal, interval, and ratio) as well as different numbers of raters. It automatically accounts for small samples, and allows its coefficient to be compared across sample sizes.\nThe calculation displayed below was done using the function kripp.alpha implemented by Jim Lemon in the package irr and is based on Krippendorff, K. (1980). Content analysis: An introduction to its methodology. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.\n\nKrippendorff’s alpha can range from -1 to +1, and it can be interpreted similarly to a correlation: values closer to +1 indicate excellent agreement between evaluators; values closer to 0 indicate there is no agreement between evaluators; and negative values indicate that there is systematic disagreement between evaluators beyond what can be expected by chance alone, such that ratings are reversed – where a given evaluator tends to rate something as high, the other(s) tend to rate it as low, and vice versa. Source: Inter-Annotator Agreement: An Introduction to Krippendorff’s Alpha by Andrew Mauboussin\n\nDespite the complexity of the calculations, Krippendorff’s alpha is fundamentally a Kappa-like metric. Its values range from -1 to 1, with 1 representing unanimous agreement between the raters, 0 indicating they’re guessing randomly, and negative values suggesting the raters are systematically disagreeing. (This can happen when raters value different things — for example, if rater A thinks a crowded store is a sign of success, but rater B thinks it proves understaffing and poor management).\n\n\nMore information about Krippendorff’s alpha and links to further reading can be found here."
