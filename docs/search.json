Moreover, the majority of methods outperform the usual benchmarks provided by the simple average or the median of estimates.\n\nHanea et al, 2021\nHowever, these are in a different context. Most of those measures are designed to deal with probablistic forecasts for binary outcomes, where the predictor also gives a ‘lower bound’ and ‘upper bound’ for that probability. We could roughly compare that to our continuous metrics with 90% CI’s (or imputations for these).\nFurthermore, many (all their successful measures?) use ‘performance-based weights’, accessing metrics from prior prediction performance of the same forecasters We do not have these, nor do we have a sensible proxy for this.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 D Veen et al (2017)\nlink\n… we show how experts can be ranked based on their knowledge and their level of (un)certainty. By letting experts specify their knowledge in the form of a probability distribution, we can assess how accurately they can predict new data, and how appropriate their level of (un)certainty is. The expert’s specified probability distribution can be seen as a prior in a Bayesian statistical setting. We evaluate these priors by extending an existing prior-data (dis)agreement measure, the Data Agreement Criterion, and compare this approach to using Bayes factors to assess prior specification. We compare experts with each other and the data to evaluate their appropriateness. Using this method, new research questions can be asked and answered, for instance: Which expert predicts the new data best? Is there agreement between my experts and the data? Which experts’ representation is more valid or useful? Can we reach convergence between expert judgement and data? We provided an empirical example ranking (regional) directors of a large financial institution based on their predictions of turnover.\nBe sure to consult the correction made here\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso seems relevant:\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Gsheet HERE, generated from an Elicit.org inquiry.\n\n\n\nIn spite of the caveats in the fold above, we construct some measures of aggregate beliefs using the aggrecat package. We will make (and explain) some ad-hoc choices here. We present these:\n\nFor each paper\nFor categories of papers and cross-paper categories of evaluations\nFor the overall set of papers and evaluations\n\nWe can also hold onto these aggregated metrics for later use in modeling.\n\nSimple averaging\nBayesian approaches\nBest-performing approaches from elsewhere\nAssumptions over unit-level random terms\n\n\n\nExplicit modeling of ‘research quality’ (for use in prizes, etc.)\n\nUse the above aggregation as the outcome of interest, or weight towards categories of greater interest?\nModel with controls – look for greatest positive residual?"
