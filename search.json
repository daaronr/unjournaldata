    "text": "Preface\nThe Unjournal coordinates the public evaluation of hosted papers and dynamically-presented research projects. We are working independently of traditional academic journals to build an open platform and a sustainable system for feedback, ratings, and assessment. Our initial focus is quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in economics, policy, and other social sciences. We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work. Our aim: to make rigorous research more impactful, and impactful research more rigorous.\nOur main web site, unjournal.org as well as our knowledge base, explain and present our vision, procedures, and our progress. The ‘output’ evaluations and author (including feedback and discussion) can be found on our PubPub page, and are indexed in scholarly archives.\nAlso see our interactive dashboards\nThis site and the accompanying dashboards present data and analysis on The Unjournal’s pipeline and evaluation output\nIn large part:\nWe may expand this analysis further in the future, e.g., to include\nThis resource aims to be:\n20 May 2024: David Reinstein, Julia Bottesini, and David Hugh-Jones have done most of the analysis here and in the accompanying dashboards.",

    "text": "3.1 About the data\nPapers1 can be suggested for evaluation either by Unjournal insiders, or by outsiders. The Unjournal then selects some papers for evaluation. I won’t focus on the details of this process here. Just note that we have more suggested papers than actual evaluations.\nEach paper is typically evaluated by two evaluators, though some have more or less than two. Getting two or more of every measure is useful, because it will let us check evaluations against each other.\nWe ask evaluators two kinds of quantitative questions. First, there are different measures of paper quality. Here they are, along with some snippets from our guidelines for evaluators:\nEach of these questions is meant to be a percentile scale, 0-100%, where the percentage captures the paper’s place in the distribution of the reference group (“all serious research in the same area that you have encountered in the last three years”).2 So, for example, a score of 70% would mean the paper is better than 70% of papers in the reference group. But note, the papers we evaluate are not randomly sampled from their reference group, so we should not necessarily expect them to be uniformly distributed on 0-100%.\nAs well as asking for each question (the midpoint or median of the evaluator’s belief distribution), we also ask for lower and upper bounds of a 90% credible interval.\nNext, we ask two practical questions about publication:\nTiers are measured from 0 (“won’t publish/little to no value”) up to 5 (“top journal”). Again, we ask for both an estimate and a 90% credible interval. We allow non-integer scores between 0 and 5.\nThe last question is especially interesting, because unlike all the others, it has an observable ground truth. Eventually, papers do or do not get published in specific journals, and there is often a consensus about which journals count as e.g. “top”.",

Do they “grok” how our percentile questions, upper bounds, and lower bounds work?\nDo evaluators take the questions seriously? Or do some of them treat them as a nuisance compared to the “real”, written review?\nBoth these questions can be partly addressed by running sanity checks. For example, do people “straightline” questions, giving the same answer for every question? Do they produce excessively narrow or wide confidence intervals?\nAre our quantitative measures accurate? Do they capture something “real” about the paper? Obviously, we don’t have access to “ground truth” – except in one case.\nAre the different measures related? Is there a single underlying dimension beneath the different numbers? Or more than one dimension?\nHow do quantitative measures relate to the written, qualitative evaluation? Does a more positive written evaluation also score higher on the numbers? Can you predict the numbers from the evaluation?\nDo evaluators understand the questions in the same way? Are different evaluators of the same paper answering the “same questions” in their head? What about evaluators of different papers in different fields?\nDo papers score differently in different fields? This could be because evaluators hold papers to different standards in those fields – or because some fields do genuinely better on some dimensions. We could ask the same question about different methodologies: for example, do randomized controlled trials score differently than other approaches?",

Out of 42 evaluation questions for which we had valid confidence intervals, 0 were degenerate and 0 were uninformative.

    "section": "3.4 Accuracy",
    "text": "3.4 Accuracy\nWe have no ground truth of whether a given paper scores high or low on our 7 dimensions. But because we usually have multiple evaluations per paper, we can take an indirect route. If two evaluators’ scores are correlated with reality, they will also correlate with each other. The converse does not necessarily hold: evaluators’ scores might be correlated because they both have similar prejudices or both misinterpret the paper in the same way. All the same, high “inter-rater reliability” (IRR) should increase our confidence that our scores are measuring something.\nIRR is complex. The basic form of most IRR statistics is\n\\[\n\\frac{p_a - p_e}{1 - p_e}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p_a\\) is the proportion of the time that two raters agree, and \\(p_e\\) is the amount of agreement you’d expect by chance if both raters are choosing independently.\nWhy not use \\(p_a\\) directly? Well, for example, suppose our raters pick an expected journal tier at random, from 0 to 5 inclusive. Clearly there’s no reliability: the data is just random noise. But one time in six, both raters will agree, simply by chance. So we need to adjust for the expected amount of agreement. To do this most measures use the marginal distributions of the ratings: in our example, a 1 in 6 chance of each number from 0 to 5, giving \\(p_e = 1/6\\). Krippendorff’s alpha is a widely accepted statistic that corrects for \\(p_e\\) and also defines “agreement” appropriately for different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1\n\n\n\n\nKrippendorf's alpha statistics for our quantitative measures.

That is, is rater 1’s midpoint estimate within rater 2’s central credible interval, and vice versa?\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2\n\n\n\n\nProportions of midpoints within other evaluators' 90% credible intervals.

This suggests that our evaluators may be overconfident.\n\n\n3.4.1 More accuracy: predicted and actual publication venues\nFor the question “What journal ranking tier will this work be published in?” evaluators give a tier from 0-5 with 5 being top, and 0 being no publication. This gives us a source of ground truth when the evaluated paper gets published.\nWhat counts as a tier 1-5 journal? Several different organizations maintain journal tier lists, and Professor Anne-Wil Harzing has collated 11 of them. Different organizations cover different journals. To get round this we impute missing data, and take the first principal component. Luckily, it turns out that this correlates highly with most of the individual rankings (Table 3.3).3\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Correlations of different journal rankings and their principal component\n\n\n\n\n\nprincomp1CnrsABDCABSDenFnegeJourQual\n\nprincomp11    0.8490.79 0.8960.68 0.9340.86 \n\nCnrs0.8491    0.6380.6810.5090.8250.698\n\nABDC0.79 0.6381    0.6910.4650.7020.589\n\nABS0.8960.6810.6911    0.5680.8430.727\n\nDen0.68 0.5090.4650.5681    0.6050.526\n\nFnege0.9340.8250.7020.8430.6051    0.78 \n\nJourQual0.86 0.6980.5890.7270.5260.78 1    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exception is the “Den” ranking (from the Danish Ministry). We checked whether “Den” added any power beyond the first principal component to predict citations or h-index data, and it didn’t.\nTo calibrate the principal component, we ran a series of ordinal logistic models predicting the different tier lists. We used just the “JourQual”, “Cnrs”, “ABS” and “Fnege” rankings, since these all had 5 tiers. Category cutoffs looked similar across all 4 rankings, so we simply took the averages to create our own meta-tier list. Figure 3.1 shows the resulting histogram of journals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Histogram of journal rankings by the Unjournal Tier List",
