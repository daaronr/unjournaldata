Second, i think that this might offer a way to begin to identify area which are - from the point of view of policy - extremely similar and yet get treated differently. As such, it might also offer a method that could be more widely applied to other policy areas (not just environment either) and possibly for thinking through causal ID from natural variation (NB: I have not given this much thought on what assumptions would be required for this to hold true, just seems like there should be something there a la more traditional matching).

Previous papers have used local variation in temperature to measure local gdp damage caused by changes in temperature to get at the impact of climate change. Broadly, 1C rise => 1-3% GDP loss at local level. This paper instead uses temporal variation in global temperature to assess the impact of temperature shocks on global gdp. These may well give different responses: shocks to local temperature are unlikely to give rise to extreme events, whereas that is not true about global shocks. Hence, global shocks may well imply much larger impacts. Indeed, they do. This paper estimates that a global temperature rise of 1C costs 12% of gdp, and implies a social cost of carbon >$1000, both are ~ an order of magnitude hiogher than when they estimate the same paramters using local changes in temperature.
I have generally argued that the UJ should NOT be reviewing papers that seek to estimate the SCC/gdp damages, but actually I think this paper is the exception: an order of magnitude change on the estimate of damages SHOULD have policy impact/be large enough to push some actors into doing something where marginal changes in the SCC/gdp damage would not.
Classic issues with these kinds of studies: I am unsure how they deal with using transient shocks to estimate long-run damages (ie how they capture long run adaptation and/or non-linearities in the damage function). Second, I think they're technically estimating the impact of temperature and all weather associated with increases in temperature, rather than a temperature effect per se - this doesnt matter at all for policy, though, it is this overall effect we care about (as long as the numbers are then not added to estimates of other weather effects)""",,,,,,,,,, The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature ,,,2024-05-15T18:27:34.235-04:00,,95%,,, The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature ,, The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature ,,,2024-06-10T00:00:00.000-04:00,

This is important from a policy perspective: it is the UN decade of restoration; restoring forest is seen as key to meeting climate obligations; many countries have reforestation targets (eg Bolivia for 1m ha of forest regrowth). Understanding where and how much might happen naturally seems crucial, and in that sense I think this paper offers neat insights. However, I think it is one paper that is likely to be (very) prestigous (under review at Nature portfolio; James Watson on the author list) which misuses ML approaches in the same way that - high profile and policy-relevant - """"science side"""" publications have abused regression analyses to get """"causality"""". Eg they are suggesting that the areas that should be prioritised are those with a high predicted ability of regrowth - possibly, but they present 0 evidence of that.

This paper claims to have provided empirical evidence of this intuition in social media, but noting the same may apply in other contexts such as luxury goods. This research might provide rationale for far reaching regulation. I think the methods deserve closer examination. For example, the trickiest part is to established that “people use something they rather not exist”. They do that using incentivized survey experiments. Of particular concern is that at a critical point, one should believe that college students believe that the researchers are able to effectively shut the social network down, or at least the relevant part of such network.

A range of interventions aimed at influencing individual behavior have been considered, but there is very limited evidence on whether these are successful. Indeed, effective altruism linked animal welfare advocates have moved away from this approach in favor of corporate campaigns. 
However, this may be from a lack of evidence rather than evidence that these interventions are ineffective.  Of course, there may be heterogeneity; these may be more effective for some audiences than others. The extent to which these initiatives and ads are targeted towards seekers, neutral people, or even potential avoiders seems actionable and potentially consequential. E.g., we could compare ‘push’ vs ‘pull’ marketing, ads targeted towards those showing interest in animals versus more neutral or ‘surprise’ ads etc.

 a credible strategy for differentiating the effects of such information/stimuli on avoiders versus seekers, in a way that seems robust to differential selection issues.  
incentivized choices (of food vouchers)
more consequential field evidence (linked to the lab experiment treatments?), with perhaps less potential for demand effects, temporary agreeability bias, etc.

In a general sense, The Unjournal is seeking to stimulate more rigorous social science research  relevant to animal welfare, including a focus on consumption attitudes.  This is one of our first forays in this direction.","Consistent with The Unjournal’s stated mission, and approach... We are  interested in the specific applied and empirical questions, and in the implications of this for animal welfare marketing interventions, and interventions in adjacent areas. We are somewhat less interested in the deep behavioral question of whether “individuals who prefer to avoid information are particularly responsive to it” (also noting that this latter relationship may itself be heterogeneous across groups and contexts) .
Consider the internal validity and external generalizability of this work. 
Are the causal claims plausible?  Do they do the WTP elicitation appropriately? 
Do they apply inverse probability weighting correctly to estimate the treatment effects?
In generalizing — Is this context reasonably representative of what future interventions are likely to involve?
To what extent are the results credibly suggest implications for longer-term diet changes (or attitudes towards animal welfare measures, perhaps)? 
How substantial are the incentives, and how well does the data capture important choices? 
How does the field data supplement the lab responses? Are there complimentary strengths and weaknesses of each?  Does the field data credibly address concerns about temporary effects, agreeableness bias, demand effects etc?
Is bias from selective attrition an issue?
Do the authors report the estimates that would be useful to animal welfare advocacy organizations? Are their other measures you would like to see reported?","Using Inverse Probability Weighting in causal inference/treatment effects

","Tabare Capitan noted “this paper is a good fit for me, in case you are looking for evaluators.. 
DR: Thanks Tabare. As of 12 Apr 2024 we are waiting for author permission. We’ll check in with them on about May 1 if they don’t get back to us earlier. ",,"Nicolas Treich  left a range of comments in an email, on an earlier version:

Here are some preliminary comments. Please note that these are immediate (not very thoughtful) reactions. I wrote everything as this came to my mind when reading the introduction, thinking this may be useful. Please note also that I only read the introduction. Hence, several comments might be irrelevant because addressed elsewhere in the paper.
 
1 Overall, the introduction looks good. It is a bit long though. Also, I understand that it may be a bit complex to write because there exists already quite a number of papers on strategic ignorance and also on the impact of information in the food domain. Therefore, it may be a bit difficult to identify the unique contribution of your paper, and different angles seem possible to present your paper. My main recommendation however would be to try to sharpen even more the message(s) in terms of the contribution with respect to the literature (both empirical and theoretical), and explain more in details why this is interesting and novel.

2 For instance, you stress that a “key question is whether deliberate ignorance is consequential for decision making”. If addressing this question is a key contribution of your paper, you should perhaps emphasize that this question has largely been ignored in the literature. Is this true?
 
3 For a theorist (like me), this might seem obvious that deliberate ignorance is “consequential” (in the sense of having consequences for decisions). Indeed, in all existing (whether behavioral or not) econ models, beliefs and information are expected to affect decisions. Could you justify a bit more why you think exploring this question is interesting? In particular, what makes you think that deliberate ignorance might be inconsequential? And further: what makes you think that your design based on having some information avoiders watching the video is particularly suited to study that question? It would be nice if you can explain more clearly why your design is “ideal” to test your specific research question.
 
4 Btw, I did not know that expression “deliberate ignorance”. I have seen on GoogleScholar that it is used with some frequency in the psychology literature. By this expression, I guess you want to emphasize here that people consciously decide to ignore information. I suppose this is in contrast to other situations where people might not be completely conscious that they ignore information, right? If you think this is an important aspect of your contribution, perhaps you should elaborate more on this, namely discuss “deliberate ignorance” as opposed to what type of ignorance.
 
5 Note that “receiving information” may not always equate to processing it. Playing devil’s advocate here, viewers of a video might devise strategies to avoid engagement. They might look away or close their eyes, lacking motivation to pay attention, or concoct stories such as deeming the content unrealistic or not representative. While I am sure you have considered these factors, they have crossed my mind, so I am sharing in case they are not discussed in the paper.
 
6 Given my background, what is missing in the introduction is a more explicit discussion about the link to the econ theory literature on strategic ignorance (and the motivated beliefs literature etc.).
 
7 It may also be nice to justify why you chose this context (animal farming) since the framing of your paper is much more general. Also, a quick discussion about the external validity about this aspect (ie, extensions to other contexts) may be useful in the introduction or elsewhere.
 
8 I notice that you do not talk about emotions (although you use the word “affective” at some point). Watching a video about intensive farming may generate emotions. In the paper, you talk about information. The link between emotions and information is not obvious. Note that we currently have a paper about the role of under videos about intensive farming and emotions. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4778679
 
9 The fact that you look at the (short and long term) impact on meat consumption is great. This is related to this paper:
“Eating to Save the Planet: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial Using Individual-Level Food Purchase Data” with Andrew Jalil and Arturo Vargas-Bustamante. Food Policy, Volume 95, August 2020, 101950
Combining lab and field experiment is also great.
 
10 Using a 360 degrees video sounds great and innovative. Should you emphasize more the advantages of this tool? But of course this also raises the issue of how specific is such an intervention. This original feature of your design sounds downplayed in the abstract/introduction. You mostly talk about information. I imagine you have thought about this a lot.
 
11 I did not get something basic: How do you lead some information avoiders to watch the video? I guessed this is due to the randomness of elicitation mechanism. Doesn’t that raise some specific econometric issues? Perhaps explain? Again, sorry for any misunderstanding. Moreover, I am not sure I understand why you show as a control a video that “all subjects have already watched at an earlier stage of the experiment”. I am not sure I understand why the video was already watched.
 
12 Your results are stimulating.
 
13 Explain in one or two sentences the Zimmerman’s conjecture that information interventions have no long term effects?
 
14 The observation that information avoiders are notably responsive to information a priori aligns with my expectation from a theorist. My initial interpretation is indeed that information avoiders may have been highly motivated to disregard information in the past, resulting in more distorted beliefs about intensive farming in general. Upon learning the truth, they subsequently update their beliefs more significantly, leading to relatively more pronounced changes in behavior than others. However, I noticed that information avoiders and information seekers seem to share similar beliefs and update similarly. You rightly emphasize the seemingly paradoxical result here. But I am confused then. How to explain this result? The paragraph where you discuss this (top of page 4) was a bit difficult to follow in a first quick reading.
 
15 Do you have info about past meat consumption? And whether there is a correlation between being a heavy meat eater and being information avoider? Our model of the meat paradox predicts a positive correlation.

Meet the standards. I think it is particularly strong, mainly because of the detail and the suggestion of seemingly viable actions that may improve the paper. I have not received any other evaluation, but I’d be surprised to find this to be the norm. 
DR
Similar comments as to the one below. We really want the evaluators to carefully and skeptically assess the credibility of the stated conclusion, whether it’s supported by the data, whether the methodology was used correctly, whether the assumptions are reasonable, etc. I didn’t see so much of this, more “here is what you could also do which would also be interesting and useful”. We want that as well, but mainly, we want to understand things like ‘what is the paper’s main claim and how much should we believe it’ (and why or why not)?
He did put some care into the ratings, which I appreciate.
TC
This evaluator has specific expertise on the method, having published in top 5 an RDD paper. He should be more familiar with the expectations in top 5 journals. He also stated having issues pointing towards any major flaws. 
DR: (Tabare Capitan ) Are we sure he was the “econometrician” on that paper? I wasn’t sure how to interpret his “having issues” comment. Do you think that meant he thought all of the choices were made optimally? But then, why not say that? Even if that is the would be good to have him weigh in a bit on ‘what choices were made and why they were justified, and what alternate choices could have been made, and why these would have been less valid’
That said, he also said he was unsure about what he was expected to do beyond a regular report. I can ask them both to add a section on “Should we believe the main claim?” Which makes me think that there may be a benefit in including a more structured report to fill, starting with that one first question. If we do this, perhaps we should explicitly tell people to address internal and external validity. Then we can leave room for flexibility. Happy to help drafting a layout for reports, if that’s something that you want to pursue.
DR: If you want to be on a group to discuss this, that would be helpful. I suspect we don’t want to ask them to do a ‘fully structured report’ but perhaps we can make some clear guidelines, as well as  perhaps adjusting/adding to the structured ratings part. 
TC: david reinstein 100% sure he was the lead on the econometrics. Might be a matter of expectations. I’ll ask both to add a bit more around whether we should believe the main claim. I think they are both willing to make some changes.","DR: 

Meet the standards. Although this evaluator has less expertise than the other one, the review is careful and detailed. Furthermore, this evaluator lives in Colombia, which gives me some reassurance in that the authors are conveying the context properly. I’d expect this to be an average-level evaluation.

David R —
 Tabare Capitan I think it meets the standards —I’d put it around the middle of our distribution (50th percentile).  I demonstrates care and it’s well organized, and he digs into some detail (also has some followup questions for the authors). And he offers some apparently useful suggestions (at a glance) ... but that’s not so uncommon in referee reports. 
But I suspect he is not being “critical” enough. We want people to take a skeptical eye to claims of causality and precise measurement. In terms of the level of scrutiny, we want people to write these evaluations and give ratings ‘as if they were writing a referee report for a ~top-5 journal’. 
He may have interpreted this differently, as more of a ‘help the authors’ thing? I suspect he would be more critical if he were not signing his name?  
 But he admits that “I am not an expert in this field nor in the econometric procedure”, so maybe this limits his ability to be critical? It’s a challenge to find people willing to do this with the exact right expertise, I agree.

My instructions (beyond the automated email) were to give a report exactly the same way in which he would do for a regular referee report in a good journal. This person has a PhD from a top school in Europe and works as AP in Colombia. Hence, although I think his expertise is adequate, he is far from the level that would be refereeing for a top 5. 

DR: Tabare Capitan  That’s fair. Maybe they would call on him for something very narrowly in his area, though.

That said, he told me that he was unable to find much to criticize because the paper was so strong; the lack of a critical view may be a reflection of that. Perhaps highlights the need to writing one brief paragraph to tell the evaluators what we expect, this may be useful even if people already interpret this as a regular referee report, since there is much heterogeneity in how people interpret this. Specially useful if the expectation is not necessarily the same as a regular report.

DR Tabare Capitan: I think we should offer a bit more structured guidance perhaps, and highlight this more (partially along the lines of my note here). I think our expectations are in some ways the same as a ‘very strong regular report’, but focusing less on innovation and cleverness. My impression is that a strong standard referee report will generally be very carefully and substantively critical, and will focus on the credibility of the main claims.

TC: david reinstein A big part of the regular review process is to assess whether the paper adds to the literature. From what I understand, the selection process of the paper is in charge of assessing whether the paper adds in terms of impact. What we want from the evaluator is that, given the expected impact, evaluate whether the claim is credible. This is a major difference that points towards the need for clear guidance for the evaluators.

By the way, why does he title this “Review of Multidimensional poverty in the Colombian pacific: identification, measurement and recent trends”? I’m a bit confused. 
One more thing — can he share the latex and bibtex files (or the raw files whatever tool he used) to write this report? We can incorporate almost any format, but not really pdfs.

TC: The title mistake was part of the reason for which I asked him to reupload the file. This should be fixed in the new file.   
DR Tabare Capitan : I need to make sure I have the right version then. I guess we’re asking for an update anyways, so that will cover it. ","See Gdoc discussion here

Important to measure and quantify this for considering the impact of policies and interventions, and perhaps even charity-driven subsidies to ‘not do something’.
But I’m not sure whether the work here is particularly cutting-edge or informative in a way that weighs on this general question and could be generalized. Not doubting, I just don’t know this  literature.
The narrow estimation (‘reduced form’) seems at a glance to be careful done and engage some important causal inference issues and approaches. The GE calibration model and simulation also seems strong, although it’s not my area. My perennial concern with such interactive intricate models though, is the many researcher degrees of freedom in terms of what to include in the GE structural model thing (as well as in traditional BLP modes), what functional forms, etc. Not that the issue is ‘p-hacking’ or opportunism, but that I don’t know how sensitive this would be to other very reasonable setups… I’ve never seen a sort of ‘many worlds’ comparison for this stuff.","Other: Economics/welfare, growth, policy, global markets and population",Does Conservation Work in General Equilibrium?,999_Other,"This paper explores whether conservation interventions have a net positive effect on the environment, once you account for potential leakage. Leakage - probably “negative spillovers” to most economists - is the idea that if we intervene with some conservation measure, we are in effect going to reduce production (typically this is agriculture, in situ, with reductions at the extensive margin; but I guess could be any other good and could be at the intensive margin). The point is that this is likely to raise the price of these goods (and substitutes) and increase production (again, either extensive or intensive margin) somewhere else.

This is IMO a key issue in a whole range of environmental issues, and has been poorly dealt with to date (exceptions I would say are the recent AER: I paper on battery recycling, and Sabrina Eisenbarth’s slightly older paper in JEEM on fisheries). Leakage is obviously a problem for identification, owing to breaking the SUTVA assumption, but perhaps more importantly is also a problem when we come to think about intervention effectiveness. Perhaps particularly relevant at the moment owing to the “additionality crisis” which has gripped the voluntary carbon market and Verra in particular. Additionality and leakage are linked in the sense that additionality = would this local effect have been observed absent intervention, and if the answer is yes, that presumably means that some production has been lost, opening up the potential for leakage. (NB: this idea is called the additionality-leakage duality in a paper by Ben Filewood, at the LSE - that itself is a decent paper aimed more at the science side).
At the minute, additionality has been addressed, but the question of leakage not really, and yet the net effect of both is crucial to understanding effectiveness. As such, I think this paper is addressing a really crucial question. It does so in the context of policies looking to limit deforestation in Brazil, which is obviously a really important area for conservation in and of itself. The findings are more optimist than I’d have predicted,  with only ~10% leakage rate (driven by intensification and reallocation of both workers and land).

This paper studies the long-term effects of the 1963 US measles vaccine, and is relevant for funding vaccines in developing countries. Previous research on this question uses reported measles cases as a proxy for disease burden. This paper improves on the literature by explicitly accounting for reporting rates. It uses two models: (1) a reduced-form ‘disease burden’ approach, regressing long-term economic outcomes on pre-vaccine measles mortality (cross-sectional) interacted with vaccine exposure (time series); (2) an epidemiological SIR model, designed to capture geographic variation in actual cases immediately before the vaccine. It finds positive effects for the reduced-form model, consistent with previous papers, but not for the epidemiological model. ","The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the reduced-form approach. From the abstract: “Our results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic literature.”
The reduced-form approach in the literature  in the literature uses reported incidence.  Chuard (2022) uses mortality in their reduced-form model, while other papers use reported incidence. Pre-vaccine mortality could arguably be a proxy for this.  But the authors don’t seem to consider whether pre-vaccine mortality correlates with reported incidence. Does this matter? 
They authors claim that reported incidence is a proxy for disease burden. Is this justified? Could they test this empirically?
How does the concept of  ‘disease burden’ apply to a universal disease like measles (with nearly 100% infection rates). In light of this, what is the identifying variation?
Do the authors clearly state their identifying assumptions? Is their identification justified? 
They do not present an event study to test for pre-trends — is this an important limitation?

Going through I4rep, I just came across this: Replication of Atwood's (2022) ""The Long-Term Effects of Measles Vaccination on Earnings and Employment"". Were you aware of it? Do you think we should reach out to one of these replicators, if we want a third?
","The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the reduced-form approach.   From the abstract: “Our results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic literature.” Michael Wiebe is this the part you were referring to? How does this ‘support the reduced form approach?’  
MW: yes, and they also have a discussion at the end of the paper. The support for the reduced-form approach is because they get the same results, which is taken as evidence in favor.
What I’m initially confused by is that the question of ‘which methodology is better’ should not be informed by ‘what the findings are’ (unless we had a gold standard to compare to). But that’s probably not what they are saying and I should look closer. 
MW: Exactly. The way they’ve framed this, they stand or fall with the Atwood (2022) results. They’ve found consistent results, but it’s possible that the method is flawed (plausible because, for measles, there’s no long-run geographic variation in incidence). In that case, both papers are wrong. (And it could be that the SIR model is right, and measles vaccination has no effect; but I have issues with those results too.)

Casper Hansen report: 
The main comment here is that this paper (and Atwood 2022) is lacking an event study to test for differential cohort trends. He also asks why the fatality rate would vary geographically, which gets at the ambiguity in the treatment variation in the reduced-form approach. These are some of the main issues I had with the paper, but a full treatment would go into more detail.","Michael Wiebe would you want to give your impressions here?

 Yes, I reached out to him politely and he responded a bit rudely, tbh. This represents a broader issue that we are tackling — should the evaluation managers and the management  ‘moderate’ the metrics in some way?
 At a traditional journal they obviously have some capacity to do something like this, but our stated approach is to transparently post all the evaluations and metrics, and try to aggregate them.","RB: I agree with Michael that this paper would likely benefit from an evaluation and that it makes claims that seem bit bigger than the current analysis can sustain (crucially around the mortality approach being better than the SIR approach).

Michael Wiebe  fwiw I’m adding some ‘sidebar comments’ in pubpub on the evaluations. These could potentially be put together into an “evaluation manager’s note”. Note we are also interested in doing more to communicate our output to more general audiences (e.g., on the EA Forum, or maybe even in Asterisk magazine or Vox etc). Perhaps this could also be repurposed there? I put some sidebar comments in the PubPub that could be incorporated into such a writeup.

From the evaluator pool I think these two might be suitable:
Michael Chaitkin https://chaitkin.com/publications/ 
Justin (Loiseau) Labeille https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinloiseaulabeille/
DR: I think generally appropriate but I’m not sure if they have specific interests in the methods or this type of intervention. IIRC Justin is more policy and less research academic?
VK: I agree, both not a perfect fit

VK: 
Alternatively maybe one of the authors of this study (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102747) citing the WP?
 https://girijabahety.com/
 https://dev-patel.com/
 https://scholar.harvard.edu/bauhoff/home
DR: Yes, I think these could be ideal. Maybe write one of them or more of them and ask them to suggest which of the co-authors might be most interested and suitable for doing this?
VK: All right, I will write maybe first to one of them and send also the invite  

VK:
What do you think about these two:
https://mcknaus.github.io/
https://www.anthonystrittmatter.com/publications
DR: Both seem ideal in terms of the methods. I guess it’s low probability that they will do it, but if one of them are willing to do so, I think it’s worth it. 
VK: I know Tony relatively well and I think he might do it, but I am also not sure, will try
Two evaluations or 3?
DR: I suggest we do this opportunistically. In addition to Dillon, let’s try to get one of the “Text don’t nudge” co-authors, and then either Mcknaus or Strittmatter. But if neither of the latter will do it, we can stick with just 2. Make sense?
VK: Makes sense. Invited now Girija Bahety, am discussing with Tony Strittmatter he says he is very busy but in general interested - maybe I can offer him also to do it until end of May? 
Valentin Klotzbücher I see a second email to Girija saved in the PubPub but not sent. You did send one. Can we delete the second one?
VK: Yes please, that was another email address but I decided to sent it to the private one - somehow the system doesn’t let me delete it (once I save/refresh it is there again). 
Discussion with Tony was not successful, he’s too busy but said he is potentially interested in evaluating other papers in the future. I told him he could join the evaluator pool. 
Starting now to look for alternatives for Girija as we haven’t heard from her. 

DR, Valentin Klotzbücher  — note there are some people above we considered but still haven’t asked
VK: Iinvited now M Knaus, and te other autors D Patel, J Potter and S Bauhoff.
Okay so M. Knaus declined and the others are not reacting so far. I guess we have to look further, priority on someone with a development/behavioral econ background. 
david reinstein: Dev Patel accepted now and I think he is a great fit. Should I write to him again and offer to talk? And I guess I should remove the other invited candidates from PubPub?!
→ Submitted evaluation but it was minimal and inadequate. 

Removed from PubPub the following invited, non-responding candidates (the 3 co-authors of Dev Patel):
James Potter 
Sebastian Bauhoff
Girija Bahety


VK:
Other potential evaluators: 
authors of Nudging toward vaccination: a systematic review
DR: seems to be targetting the same question with a different approach; seems promising
and/or https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01813-4 ?
DR: Also seems highly relevant to the context, and they should have a good perspective on the literature
DR: but for both of these papers, 
so many authors so it's hard to know which one has the right expertise
Is there expertise in developing country context?
Will they be familiar at all with the statistical approaches used and with the ~econometrics involved? Not sure there are economists here
I know Hengchen Dai from a different project I was involved in and if I recall, she was pretty good. Maybe she would be good to ask and feel free to mention my name? Perhaps it would be better to just ask her in an email and let her make the decision whether she has the relevant expertise to engage in detail with some of the questions here?
VK: completely agree, not sure who of the authors to ask and whether they have sufficient background knowledge for this case. Asking Hengchen Dai first sounds like a good strategy → wrote to her, she is busy but potentially available in the future.

DR: One concern — last update April 2021, for such a big project. I’m surprised there is nothing newer. As well as contacting the authors soon, we should do some snooping around. 
DR: My pet peeve — LASSO is not meant as a technique for ‘selecting coefficients’

“The most cost-effective policy (information hubs, SMS reminders, no incentives) increases the number of immunizations per dollar by 9.1%” —- this is not a value/cost measure because it depends on the immunization base rate etc. Encourage them to estimate and report even more relevant Benefit/Cost measures

DR: At a glance, seems substantive and strong, useful technical content, careful approach to the ratings.  ","DR: I’m also somewhat interested  in seeing if their approach is deemed methodologically appropriate by experts in adaptive design, “First, we use a LASSO technique to collapse the data: we pool dosages of the same treatment if the data cannot reject that they had the same impact, and prune policies deemed ineffective.”  (Max Kasy, perhaps).  Not sure  what this has to do with LASSO; I guess they meant something else in the abstract. Also ‘cannot reject’ can simply be a lack of power; is this approach theoretically grounded?
Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winner’s curse. — interesting, evaluator should consider if their correction is the right one. 
Incentives vs reminders etc... this would seem to inform charities like “New Incentives”

Technology-driven growth of US per-capita incomes has averaged about 1.3 percent per year. A full percentage point of that comes from increasing the fraction of the population doing R&D and from improving the allocation of talent, such as by reducing gender and racial discrimination. 29
29. Jones 2021, Figure 2, 15.
Over the last few decades, population growth has contributed about 0.3 percentage points to the United States’ technologically driven per-capita growth rate.
30. Jones 2021, Figure 2, 15. The claim that population growth also increases per capita incomes (rather than contributing to GDP just by increasing the number of workers) is precisely the essence of semiendogenous growth theory: more people find more ideas, which, because of their nonrival nature, make everyone more productive.
we could avert stagnation if we develop breakthrough technology in time. We might develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) that could replace human workers—including researchers.48

(A few things to keep in mind: We just need to be discrete about evaluating him as an evaluator ... maybe skip that. Also, we need to note this relationship in the final report.)

Have you emailed Maria and Michael directly? Sometimes the PubPub email goes to spam or gets ignored. 

I think it’s probably good to overbook a bit. I’ll make some further suggestions for people to invite below, if that is OK. 

DR: potentially relevant evaluators from our volunteers:

Mirela Zaneva might be relevant — have a look? The impact of monetary poverty alleviation programs on children’s and adolescents’ mental health: A systematic review and meta-analysis across low-, middle-, and high-income …

Rosie Bettle It’s been 6 days, probably worth nudging the invited people and/or asking some more people. It’s ok to overbook a bit.
",,,,,,,3,47 days,2024-05-08T00:00:00.000-04:00,,,,"DR: It seems detailed and well-done, although I don’t know the context well. My guess is it’s at least in the top third (66%) of our evaluations in terms of quality. (Note: I wrote the ‘at least in the top-third’ comment without remembering that this was an evaluator on our team.)
RCB: Caveat that this is my first time seeing reviews, but (even before I saw your comment above) I think this review is very strong. I don’t think this is the review from the evaluator within our team, I believe that’s the other review? FYI that I directed them to payment a few days ago, I think this has now all gone through.
DR Rosie Bettle it occurs to me that, unless they use the hash code we gave them, we have no way of tracking which is which. Looking into how to make this possible in the future. 

For now I’ll just Slack the internal evaluator, and ask them which one was their work. 
","Rosie, after the evaluator’s improvements, noted:
I reckon like 55th percentile? I think it’s now solid without being as good as the other one (~66th percentile) 

...

DR: Clearly read the work and some useful suggestions but these are sort of ‘maybe it would also be good to do this’ suggestions. Would like more detailed and incisive critiques and suggestions.  About 35th percentile I think. 

Rosie Bettle What do you think? — would you like to ask this evaluator to follow up with a bit more detail? We want to recontact them anyways because they shared a pdf (we prefer a raw file format like docx, tex, markdown, etc.)

RCB: Yeah I agree, I find this review less helpful than the 1st one. How about i ask them for more detail on how serious they think the potential for demand effects was, aka if they think the key results would replicate if there was no possibility of demand effects? (Potential for demand effects seems helpful to me, since it’s not really covered in 1st review. But also happy to ask for more detail generally).
Rosie Bettle That makes sense. Perhaps split the difference and ask them for more detail, mainly on the demand effects issue. 
RCB: Done! Thanks
Rosie Bettle I haven’t had a chance to look in detail but I think this would increase the ‘percentile rating for the evaluation’ substantially. Do you agree? It’s ~important to update this because we’ll use these to award prizes and incentives.

RB had a pubpub access issue, took a while but we sorted it, I think. The paper is in the system, 2 people were invited (one field specialist, but it’s OK). ","Against: there is a reasonable body of evidence testing psychotherapy in LMICs (Bolton et al 2003, Bolton et al. 2005, Thurman et al. 2017, upcoming RCT testing StrongMinds), and there is a large literature on the effect size of therapy more broadly. So there are other (probably more relevant) papers to get an effect size estimate of e.g. StrongMinds and other relevant charities from.
For: there’s significant uncertainty around the length of impact of therapy in LMICs, which this paper addresses- finding an impact 4 to 5 years later. I’m not aware of other work testing for long-run impacts in LMICs. I think this is actually quite important for producing CEAs (to decide whether to fund this kind of work), and potentially overlooked relative to debates over immediate effect size.

Charlotte Lane Evaluation 1 is in. Could you have a look and give some comments here? 
I think she makes good points, but maybe did not understand that this was already a published paper as opposed to a traditional journal review. I doubt that would change her conclusions, just her tense and tone. 
DR: You mean ‘published as in available online’, not as in ‘peer reviewed’, right?  Actually, I’m not sure, do you think the authors will try to get this in a journal?
CL: Overall, I am not particularly surprised by the types of critiques she has, as she is a strong methods reviewer. I very much agree with her comments regarding the use of causal language, search and screening processes for SRs, and expected reporting requirements. There are pretty firm standards in the field for these.
Also, I find it interesting to see the difference between her comments / tone and her actual assessments. While the comments come off as quite critical, the scores are actually quite positive. 
I was a bit surprised that she said she is not an expert in the area as she has published on the effects of other toxins (largely tobacco and cannabis) on child development. So, related, but I guess not exactly in her field. 

DR: I was not so happy with the evaluation. It more or less meets our minimum standards, but it didn’t really seem to dig into the technical issues or the specifics of the paper.  It felt a bit boilerplate, simply going down the list and saying things like ‘this is missing citations’ and ‘this is missing a PRISMA flowchart’. Generally fair points, but not engaging the evaluator’s expertise, not addressing issues with the more technical and detailed analyses: meta-regression, publication bias corrections, heterogeneity, IV vs OLS comparisons, etc. Also not engaging the evaluator’s expertise on child development. I’d say it’s about at the 15-20th percentile for our evaluations.  
Update DR — I think I was a bit too harsh, maybe 30-35th percentile. 
","DR: they seem to have taken the exercise seriously, and are thinking critically in terms of evidence value etc. Wrote to them and got their report which was not attached initially.  It seems substantive. Maybe 60-70th percentile.

There are a few growth economists, like Stanford professor Chad Jones, who have done pioneering work considering longer timescales.16 In their models, both faster-thanexponential growth and near-zero growth arise quite naturally and should be taken seriously as possibilities.17
17. For an overview, see Appendix B of Davidson (2021b). In much of the literature, the possibilities of faster-than-exponential and near-zero growth are set aside because they don’t fit Kaldor’s (1957) “stylised facts” that describe observed growth in the industrial era. For recent exceptions, see Nordhaus (2021) and Aghion et al. (2019) regarding faster-thanexponential growth, and C. Jones (2020) regarding near-zero growth.
In this situation, our best models of economic growth predict the pace of innovation will fall to zero and the level of technological advancement will plateau.20
20. This is implied by both endogenous and semiendogenous growth models (Jones 2021, 27). For a detailed analysis of a negative-population-growth scenario, see Jones (2020).""",,Gavin Taylor,,,,,,,,The end of economic growth?

It runs through key arguments in favor of certain types of regulation (developing standards, licensing, monitoring) and what such regulation might entail.

BBalmford: this does not seem like a priority for evaluation to me. Basically, it considers the theoretical properties of the quadratic funding mechanism for public good provision. They show that this mechanism has a more limited set of instances in which it is efficient than was previously known. While that is interesting, it does not seem all that relevant to me.
Yes, public good provision matters hugely. But this mechanism that they explore is very seldom used (if at all) in the real-world. In part, I would assume, because it is rather cognitively complex to understand. In this light, I kind of see their results as saying this mechanism which is not used anyway, and there is no great push to consider using, might not be as good as we thought… and then I kind of think “so what”? what do we really learn from that.","Other: Economics/welfare, growth, policy, global markets and population",Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,deprioritized -- low ratings,,Ben Balmford,David Reinstein,,,,,,,,Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,,30%,42%,Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,,Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,,"Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information,Quadratic Funding with Incomplete Information",,

I agree with Hansika, it is interesting to see policy recommendations from academics → policy → evaluations. Methodologically, this seems like a qualitative expert-led meta-analysis really. I think that might have some pros vs a meta analysis (broadly bringing expertise in should help) but also perhaps some flaws (eg experts suddenly have the freedom to read what they want to/understand what they want from something, where in a meta analysis that freedom may be more curtailed). However, I would flag that like a meta-analysis, this paper is not getting at causality at all - or rather relies on the identification of the papers underpinning it - and clearly a bunch of those are non-causal. Indeed, the authors write “As depicted in Fig. 1, the direction of effect or correlation suggested by most claims were generally supported.”... And I would be very surprised if those leaders enacting policy which aligns with the recommendations set out in the original behavioural policy are not also more broadly following good policy. IE I think causal identification is a massive issue here - and I think causal identification should also be a big consideration for the UJ if we’re saying something about what policy should do/trying to shape policy + impact.
For the whole academic suggestion → policy → evaluation pathway, I actually think that lockdowns offer a much better example, in part because there have been several papers very precisely identifying the causal effect of lockdowns in several places.","Innovation, meta-science, and research",A synthesis of evidence for policy from behavioural science during COVID-19,01_Needs prioritization/assessor rating,"From a behavioral science point of view, this is a very important synthesis, covering the lifecycle of policy suggestions to empirical tests, and sometimes even policy implementation.

This seems like a somewhat substantive evaluation. I don’t think it digs into the methods or the fundamental cost-benefit calculation relevant questions as much as I’d like. They also provided meaningful ratings numbers.   
I’m not sure if the substantive comments/critiques make sense (I could look deeper, although this is not my area of expertise). They emphasize the value of decomposition and an explicit counterfactual model, and incorporating variables that cover individual characteristics (gender, education age) — are these really important in this RCT setting? 

There is also at least one thing that he should clarify: We asked “Approximately how long did you spend completing this evaluation?” ... and he responded “45 minutes”. 
We intended this question to mean ‘how much time did you spend reading the paper, considering it, writing up your concerns, considering our ratings, etc.’ The whole thing. I’m guessing he just meant it took 45 minutes to fill out the form — should we ask him to clarify? (And perhaps I should reword this question).","David Reinstein quick thoughts
Not substantive enough → do not post 
 Emmanuel Orkoh my impression is that this evaluation was very limited. The evaluator identified not seem to delve into the methodology or offer any substantive critiques. It seems to praise the paper a bit excessively. “The paper must be published in a class A-journal”  etc. 
(Aside: They also mention  several times “‘the labor surplus model of Lewis (1954)” and the “perfectly elastic supply of labor curve existent in the literature” ... but my rough impression is that this is not really the state of the art of the literature anymore.)
Remember — we are particularly interested in this work as a way of reconsidering the cost/benefit of the (now closed) “No Lean Season” charity, and other potential interventions in this area in the future.
This evaluator also did not seem to understand what we intended in parts of our form. In particular, their ‘credible intervals’ seem to always include 0.  Perhaps we should coach them on this a bit more?
I would rate this evaluation as in the bottom 5%, among the least useful that we have receIved.
","See Gdoc discussion here
IIRC the seasonal labour migration is generally accepted to not scale very well, so Givewell might not find much value in extra evaluation.
DR: @Gavin Taylor it still might be worth exploring further: 1. as a general issue, 2. because the NLS ‘failure’ (as stated by Givewell: https://blog.givewell.org/2019/06/06/evidence-action-is-shutting-down-no-lean-season/#2017Study)  seemed to be largely about management issues and evidence that it didn’t actually lead to net emigration … but effects of emigration (if it indeed could be influenced) could still be  helpful to know  3. to understand ‘why it failed’ if so.  We don’t want to ‘overlearn’ or learn the wrong lessons.

The authors here (quick look) seem to claim the transportation subsidies they offered had an impact on migration. Could be useful to better understand the discrepancy, if there is one.
That said, I’m thinking this paper is probably not up-to-date so maybe. worth waiting to see if something else comes out
@david reinstein yeah, I didn’t check if the authors had any newer publications on the intervention. The senior author (Mobarak) does have other publications on migration (some in NBER), could be worth reaching out to see if he would be interested in having work evaluated and could suggest the most relevant

Anton Korinek is GPI associated","This paper provides a good high level overview of some key issues related to AI, innovation, and development. The topic that it tackles is important, and this was a (relatively) early paper in the space that I think has influenced some academic and policy conversation on AI. That said, my view is this paper likely should not be highly prioritized for assessment, because:
Most of the substantive claims in this paper are made via qualitative argumentation, rather than backed by a theoretical model as in the initial section of the paper. The paper may thus be out of scope for evaluation.
One could argue that the model is stylized and could likely be adapted to the various questions raised in the rest of the paper. But as it stands, the paper reads more like a literature review (in the sense that it hits on many different issues briefly, rather than analyzing one issue in depth), and a typical reader would probably gain less from a thorough discussion of this paper prepared by evaluators than other papers being considered for evaluation. This is because the claims made are not especially ‘deep’ (meaning, relatively easy to assess by people without a deep background) and there are many of them, so somebody who is reading an evaluation of each claim may as well read the claims themselves (which are typically only 2-3 paragraphs in the paper).
There are other papers that discuss similar issues by the same authors that are likely more suitable for this review process. See for instance, https://www.nber.org/papers/w31815 for a more technical/quantitative treatment of the same topics. For those looking for a more general (non-technical) review of the many potential impacts of AI, there are many articles online about this already. Given quick progress in this field, more recent writing is likely to be more applicable for people to read.
Summary: this paper ranks highly on global decision relevance, is relatively prominent, but perhaps not influential.

These also often relevant to important/impactful global health interventions (see e.g., this Guardian article), as well as  measures to control the spread of pandemics.   (But we have some disagreement about how impactful the nudge parts of the interventions are.]
We also had some doubts about the particular concerns about nudges expressed in this paper in terms of their importance in a global impact sense. 
At least at a skim, the paper assumes/considers a case where the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies. Thus the impact of nudges 'in equilibrium with the government response' has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the 'best compromise'.  This approach to the question is fairly standard from a public economics pov. 
The issue still seems a bit less than first-order.

But arguments about this may still be influential. We perceive some important pushbacks against the ‘nudge agenda’, and this may be a fairly central issue.  The authors are prominent and there is some chance that the paper itself will influence policy, perhaps entering into the considerations of ‘nudge units’ or the arguments made against particular interventions. 
“It is quite a substantive paper and I think an evaluation could get into both the theory and details of the experiments”
","Some issues that came to me (David R.) after a skim of the paper:
Is a model in which government adjusts taxes/subsidies optimally a relevant one for this discussion? Do their arguments meaningfully carry over to a more general environment?
“Welfare also depends on whether the NPI reduces the variance of distortions from heterogenous biases and externalities, and the average effect becomes irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes.”
Is this main argument correct, are there flaws in it, is it robust to relevant small modifications in the theoretical model?
“We apply our framework to randomized experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels ...” These experiments were run on a particular pool of participants, asking questions about particular contexts. 
Are the inferences made from these participants in this context meaningful? Does the experiment itself add any ‘value of information’? I.e., do we know more about something important in the real world, adjusting or concentrating our beliefs, after having seen the results of the experiment 
(If so) do the results in this context meaningfully generalize in ways that will help inform (globally) important real-world policies?  
There were some real incentives to choose according to one’s true preferences (in the drinks case?) or to get state WTP ‘correctly’ as imputed from their earlier survey responses (in the autos case).   
Were these incentives strong, meaningful, and correctly aligned?
... Usual considerations about statistical modeling of the results, statistical inferences, structure of any structural (?) model used to derive welfare implications; consistency with pre-registration/pre-analysis plan

","David R – I’d particularly value evaluators with:

 ... first yield after going through the Evaluator Pool - you might find a hint of my preference for generalist econ thinkers as opposed to subfield specialists. Happy to be overridden:
Max R. P. Grossmann - stumbled upon him in the list when searching 'equilibrium' and had a good feeling, as general good economist
Gulbike Mirzaoglu - applied econ & quant with some behavioral/risk aspects; also seems good impression.
Neither of these are specifically behavioral economics experimenters. But I'm actually at least slightly less worried about the experiments per se in the paper, and more interested in the relevance/applicability of the observations in general (I see there the largest issue I have with the paper so far).
Still, if you find a more typical behav econ gamer would be preferable - or for any other suggestions -... 
DR: Florian Habermacher
Max seems like a strong fit for several reasons: Experimental economics, research on  ‘choice architecture‘ , let’s ask him.
I’m not convinced Gulbike has the right skills and interest for this one. 

I’d particularly value evaluators with
an applied understanding of public finance/public econ. theory, considering normative issues
experience considering the value of framed choice experiments and elicitations like this, and how generalizable they are to real world markets of interest. 
Actually not sure if the paper is really ‘behavioral’ per se; at least it’s not considering any particular psychological ‘biases’.
I also thought of Bob Sugden, as he’s spoken and written a bit skeptically of “the Nudge agenda”. I believe he has the public econ understanding in spades. Maybe not so much the choice/experiment relevance and generalizability thing. But getting his input would also be great for The Unjournal. I think David Hugh-Jones has some contact with him as well, he could put in a good word perhaps.
Florian: Agree with everything that has been written here (esp. that the eval action will be less in ‘behavioral’ subtleties per se); would highly appreciate Bob Sugden (didn’t know him but after quick googling..).
david reinstein Should I ask Max now? (Scholar GPT finds no conflicts, i.e. no co-autorships)
By the way   I sketched an outreach to Bob Sugden here, but it may make more sense for David Hugh-Jones to contact him first, as David HJ is closer to Bob than I am.

Seems to misunderstand the theoretical framework a bit:
Implicit in this paper’s consideration is that government interventions rarely care about average effects on the population, but on particular groups. In this sense, the effort to consider non-mean effects on welfare is welcome.
I don’t think the theory or the experiments are so concerned with ‘heterogeneity by real world groups’ for it’s own sake (but maybe I’m wrong).

His discussion of the limitation of the incentives seems correct to me.
I’m not sure whether the discussion of multiple comparisons in measuring heterogeneity is right here — Florian Habermacher What do you think?. 

Florian Habermacher we should also ‘evaluate the evaluations’ here. ","DR: ~85th-90th percentile. Clear understanding of the theoretical context. Well written. Raised some relevant issues about the experimental design and inherent biases. Could have dug into the theory a bit more, and perhaps the global impact (a bit of editorializing). 
","DR: I partially disagree with Ryan in that I think that these nudges may have rather large effects on key health and environment behaviors, or at least policymakers may think they do and improving the PMs’  beliefs may have a lot of of value. However, the lab-like nature of the evidence may limit its influence and impact (even though the authors are fairly prominent). The theoretical part of their work might have more influence, but I’m not sure.
OK reading a bit more,~~ the ‘second order effects of nudge on equilibrium prices distorting choices’~~ aspect, seems like it might be fairly unimportant in a global impact sense. Correction – their model assumes (?) the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies, and thus the impact of nudges ‘in equilibrium with the government response’ has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the ‘best compromise’.  This still seems a bit less than first-order, but perhaps somewhat more consequential.
[And also/on the other hand] if the ‘paper itself will influence policy’ (which I’m not convinced about) it could be impactful for us to have this evaluated, and beneficial for us to engage.

FH: “How many evaluators do we typically want? 2-3?”

Discussion of appropriate evaluators. ","I think this is a good, interesting paper that nonetheless isn’t likely to be a very top contender for an evaluation (but could still be usefully evaluated by us).
In its favour:
Nudges are common and so understanding their welfare effects is important
It is quite a substantive paper and I think an evaluation could get into both the theory and details of the experiments
Against it
I don’t think the welfare effects are *that* large, and so even grouping it into a “near term, human welfare” comparison group I don’t think it would be as important as many other papers
Related to above, I also don’t see the tractability angle here strongly
The easiest way for me to flip from a 75 to 90 on this would be to convince me that the welfare effects are much larger that I think (note: I do not mean in their samples, but rather that their results will likely actually end up being used in lots of place and actually affecting very many people in very positive ways).

The topic is important, speaking to key issues in the AI and automation literature.
They have a couple of key findings, some of which replicate results others have found in more labbish settings: (1) that AI is meaningfully improves worker productivity, but primarily at the low end of the skill distribution, (2) that AI accelerates learning and helps people gain more experience; this effect persists even when the tool is unavailable, and (3) that there is no quantity-quality tradeoff. Workers can process more cases without any observable loss in quality. While claim (1) has been documented before, (2) and (3) are fairly novel and seem credible. Overall, the identification strategy is plausible (although a quick scan raises some questions that would be good for an evaluator to dig into—how exactly were teams selected for staggered adoption of the tool?).
My reservations for evaluating the paper are: (1) external validity and scope. The paper tackles a vary narrow type of job—customer support—and it is unclear the extent to which results will generalize to others. The actual impact of the industry studied in this paper is small (but this is a smaller concern in my mind, given that we are still in the early days of a rapidly developing tech), and (2) not directly being about automation itself. The paper is about AI augmenting human work, which is obviously of interest, but largely stays away from discussing any implications this might have on actual job automation.

I believe this has largely been based on anecdote, while this study provides survey data that appears to provide strong support that reviewers, particularly domain experts, are often in favour of funding grants where there is variance (i.e. dissent) between reviewer scores (instead of only focusing on the mean score).
These findings are directly relevant to funder policy and amenable to real-world policy experiments; the authors even suggest where that could be done (NSF). Indeed, it seems likely that these findings will be used to support advocacy for policy experiments at top funding agencies. 
One point that I think could benefit from detailed technical evaluation is considering how reliably conclusions can be drawn from the medium (250-300 respondents) sample size of this survey. While this seems relatively highly powered, respondents randomly received one of 86 survey versions, and there appears to be a relatively large number of variables in play, which leads me to worry whether there is a strong signal in the dataset. 
Additionally, the literature review only briefly mentions that considering dissensus between reviewers may increase the funding allocated to radical but high return projects (based on several relatively dated references). It would have been helpful if they summarized the conceptual discussion of pros and cons of such reform in more detail, given that investigating it forms the basis of their survey. Discussion on (if not the practice of) funding reform has continued during the last decade, and it would be helpful for an evaluator to contextualise how the results of this study relate to the current discussion (although much of this is likely to be in grey literature, there are at least some relevant editorals).","Innovation, meta-science, and research",Choose Your Moments: Peer Review and Scientific Risk Taking,02_final consideration needed,"Designing systems to induce researchers taking more risk is important and has relevance on GPI related things to some extent, where often the research coming from GPI is seen as more ‘risky’/unorthodox.

This seems a highly policy relevant question, particularly as the world urbanises and given that a bunch of local governments have the option of making decisions which could affect urban greenery. These are also ecosystem (dis)services which I don’t think have been looked at very much in this context (vs, say, recreation benefits, and to a lesser extent possibly also reductions in flooding). I also like how they decompose effects: policy -> changes in greenery -> changes in pollutants -> changes in health outcomes (rather than just policy -> changes in health outcomes).
I have some issues with interpretation which might be worth flagging, but none of them change my assessment that this is a good paper that has clear policy implications. First, they look at the impact of the policy vs historic baseline, rather than trying to construct a counter factual of what might have happened absent the policy (eg by looking at changes in greenery in other cities similar to Beijing over the same time scale – natural regrowth may have happened anyway, other cities may have had other policies). This point does not at all affect anything other than SPECIFIC POLICY -> GREENERY (which is IMO the least important step). Second, this is about changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ie how green something is) not specifically about forests (tho the two are obviously linked). Third, and similarly, I am not sure they define what constitutes a forest vs just some trees – like how big does a patch have to be to be a forest… and this seems relevant because there’s a choice to be made too about how to plant a fixed amount. Finally, I think they could say more about distributional effects. They talk a little bit about it regarding house prices (which do capitalise greenspace recreation value, and not air pollution improvements, in line with previous work) but they don’t really talk about the fact that pollution affects everyone broadly equally (perhaps worst for those with lung issue) Vs pollution only being for people with allergies; and just more broadly which sets of various distributions are getting the benefits.","The Environment: Harm to human health, biodiversity, risks and climate change",Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks,,"Air quality in Asian cities has been investigated by several EA funders (OP, founders pledge).

Abstract:
Most large US food retailers and restaurants have made pledges to sell only cage-free eggs. If the pledges are upheld, about 75% of the egg laying flock will have to be converted to cage-free by the year 2025. However, it is an open question as to whether the market will support such a change. To address this issue, a national survey of over 2,000 US egg consumers was conducted to estimate cage-free egg demand among consumers exposed to different types of information. We find a high degree of heterogeneity in willingness-to-pay (WTP) for cage-free eggs. Half of the consumers are WTP no more than a $0.30/dozen premium for cage-free eggs; however, the mean premium is $1.16/dozen, suggesting a small fraction of consumers are willing to pay sizeable amounts for the cage-free label. Ultimately, the results suggest there is potential for the market-share for cage-free eggs to rise above the current state even at premiums as high as $1.00/dozen. However, even at much more modest price premiums, the potential for cage-free eggs to attain majority market share is unlikely, particularly if conventional eggs advertise other desirable attributes. We also find that retailers who completely remove more affordable, conventional eggs are likely to experience a significant increase in the share of consumers who choose not to buy eggs.",Josh Tasoff,David Reinstein,,,"animal welfare,consumer preferences",,,,,Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges,,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,65%,70%,68%,Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges,,Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges,,"Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges,Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges,Consumer preferences for cage-free eggs and impacts of retailer pledges",,

Positives: Allocating research funds is a high-value potentially high-impact space. These questions may inform our own (Unjournal) practice as well as  those of our funders/in our space. Appears well-written and credible data and statistical work.  The energy research context of the research itself seems medium-impactful (I think 80000 hours mentioned being an (D)ARPA grantmaker at some point).

Florian Verdict: Verdict: Weak yes; despite a non-top discussion of various points, the core experiment seems a top innovation and with some potential to adopt more widely and potentially improve.
Florian Musings (ignore if not keen on non-decisive points; also I have not read all sections in detail so maybe don’t do fully justice to the authors):
a) Why the heck would participant’s intuition be taken at face value for animal’s suffering? Don’t we have much too many reasons for really not wanting to trust lay (or even expert) intuitions about it?! Doesn’t the meat industry use gazillions to paint green idyllic grass with smiley hens over their hellish factories, just to give us a wrong picture? (in my country infamously even using public money for it, and so successfully that my friends too kind to even harm a fly are misled to think conventional animal farming is acceptable!). (to be fair, I guess this is mostly a question of wording: I had the impression the authors suggest a bit too much, their estimates are estimates of the actual ‘animal welfare cost’, rather than of a people’s highly questionable ideas about them).
b) Ok, from a democratic perspective, we could base a representative/elected planner’s decision on the population’s pure intuition, fair enough. But then, let’s make a more clear distinction between the abstract planner (human-preference-disregarding dictator?) maximizing perfectly animal+human welfare, and instead focus directly on human+alpha*animal welfare, where alpha is the folk’s altruistic concern for animals.
c) Why sleep?! Why forgetting?! Why not a pill that temporarily does transform your (awaken!) experience to that of the animal; maybe even transforms you into it!? Sleep, and esp. with forgetting, introduces a potentially highly random and strong bias: I often wonder about how strongly we discount our own welfare during sleep. Say I can influence whether I have painful nightmares or pleasurable dreams. I believe in the worst case I might panic immediately before sleeping, but would still risk to heavily underinvesting into sleep welfare: a strong potential discount. More, if you tell me, I actually have also many bad dreams, during which I suffer, but those I always forget, I could even imagine I’d take this up as an interesting factoid – but on which I might barely react! Or: Depending on subtle details about my personality – or maybe whether simply whether at a given moment, I’m a bit more rushed or instead in a more mindful state of mind, I might care almost not at all - or instead a ton! Could that add to the extreme heterogeneity they find in people’s WTAs – rather than genuine differences in people’s animal welfare intuitions? => I could imagine literature has investigated ‘discounting of sleep welfare’ but haven’t checked. I’d find it an exciting avenue for further research: Future experiments could readily be extended to check on this, by randomizing whether the ‘sleep’ layer is at all introduced, as well as the ‘forgetting’.
d) [related also to b)] From a human society’s/democratic perspective, there’s an argument to be made that the more ‘actionable’ externality is the public-good externality related to me caring about the welfare of your meat, rather than the externality of the animal not having a say. I have the impression the authors ignore that point.

","Karger suggestions
‘Is this generally important?’ 
Is the data/release of the data useful?  [where can we find this]
Did they explain it well?
 
Digging into the subresults:  A handful of experts in any topic. Very few in some areas. AI has a few more.  They have specific subsections for each topic area. 
We could ask experts ‘are they correctly describing the debates in this space?’ Did they ask the right questions? Are these really people with the right expertise?
We don’t need to do our usual ‘pay two evaluators’ 

FRI ‘next steps’ post
FRI  made an EA Forum post seeking input on the next steps, for their next version. Some of these suggest things to evaluate, especially... 
1. Deliberation/consensus-building process: They expected “deliberation and argument would lead forecasters to update on one another’s beliefs and arguments and eventually converge on similar probabilities.” But this did not occur on questions where they disagreed most.
Were their expectations wrong here? Does previous work suggest this convergence would not happen? 
Were their methods of facilitating deliberation insufficient? Are there better approaches they should use?
[AH] Was the entire protocol designed such that shifting was a natural thing to do?
2. Methods of eliciting low-probability forecasts: ~ ’People are bad and inconsistent at giving probability forecasts for rare events’. This may apply to area experts and superforecasters too.  
How should we expect this to have biased or frustrated their approach?
What are some better methods for eliciting these rare event forecasts, training people to be better at them, and measuring reliability of forecasters (for weighting the forecasts) in this domain? 
[AH: there is a literature on earthquake elicitation etc. — Annemarie Christophersen from GNS science, NZ would know loads about that]

Unjournal suggestions for issues to evaluate
'Reciprocal scoring':  Is the 'reciprocal scoring' rule likely to motivate honest (incentive-compatible) predictions? Is it likely to generate useful information in this context?
For all this to generate value, they seem to rely a lot on being able to compare reciprocal accuracy to real-world accuracy starting in 2024. [AH is there enough evidence to suggest reciprocal accuracy is a good predictor of real accuracy? ]This suggests that if these does correlate (in certain ways), they will then look to the remaining ‘reciprocal data’ to make predictions about the real world for events further in the future. But is this reasonable? Did their study really produce data that will enable them to powerfully consider this and reliably make inferences?
[AH] there are a couple of results showing that how people present themselves is very (positively) correlated with how they are perceived and scored by their peers,  but there’s no correlation between that ranking and the performance in terms of accuracy, calibration or informativeness.

more accurate reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk 

But is this meaningful, or is it just simply that the unusual people who thought there is high X-risk thought others are likely to think the same? Is it more finely grained 'better reciprocal accuracy' than that?
Also, this correlation seems to hold visually, but I don't see metrics or statistical inference here. 
Is there a lack of statistical power?

Recruitment etc.:
Was the choice of ‘experts’ reasonable?  Were the other groups recruited in ways that would tilt them towards one side or the other, or towards being intransigent? Were there ‘cultural things’ going on; do Superforecasters have particular characteristics or biases that might make them especially optimistic about x-risk, or to be hostile to the arguments of effective altruists and x-risk doomsayers? And vice/versa?
Were there implementation issues in the recruitment of superforecasters, as this thread suggests?
[AH] were superforecasters identified as such, for them and for other groups?
Should we be concerned about a potential bias due to the substantial attrition?

Prediction question choice and framing: 
Were the prediction questions relevant? 
Were they well-framed?
They seem to have displayed these along with particular “Prior Forecasts” — is that appropriate? Could that be driving the persistent difference between the superforecasters and experts?
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] Framing of ‘questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks’ — 
I suspect there is a prior literature on ‘eliciting policy choices’ from the public and policymaker participants. Did they set this up well?

Other survey/experimental methods issues
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact...]  “Public survey of 912 college graduates” — 
This ‘general population survey’ is obviously a well-studied method. Did they do this well (recruiting methods, survey elicitation instrument, etc.)?

Statistical analysis and reporting: 
Is the focus on the median forecast and the bootstrapped confidence interval the right choice here (their argument for this is rather informal)? 
What about the other aggregation methods they use? Which seems most useful, or is another approach warranted? True ‘the large gaps between expert and superforecaster beliefs are robust across aggregation methods’, and it appears so in the tables they show. However, it would be helpful to get some expert consideration of this for future work. It is not easy to know if all of the possible results presented are robust to all reasonable aggregation methods.
 Other studies let the aggregation methods compete.  Tetlock’s group often advocates for the extremizing one, which seemed to perform best for near-term followup event.

(See above on “reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk.”)

[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] “Assessments of risk were highly correlated” — they present some ad-hoc statistics here, but they don’t really model this. If this correlation indeed holds, is this useful, or is it meant to reflect something else that helps us interpret the results? In either case, is their a better way to statistically model and test this? 

Presentation and communication: 
Visuals and summary statistics: Are there more useful and informative ways of presenting the (differences in) the forecasts? 
Can you recommend some easy ways to add value here? Given the data shared, would it easy to convert this into a hosted ‘dashboard’ style?

Overriding issues
What exactly was the goal of this project and this analysis? To generate the highest quality forecasts? If so, what is the case for their particular approach.
Did they preregister?

Other methodology things (integrate above)
Why is the protocol the way it is? Why the separate groups and then the mixed groups?
Did you ask them about uncertainty, why not?
Was the discussion synchronous and is there any analysis about synchronous  vs. asynchronous conditioning for convergence results.

Parts of the paper to skip or skim
Although the paper appears very long, much of it could be skipped or skimmed. A lot is background for lay people that our evaluators are likely to already know. Much also  involves detailed descriptive presentation of the results. The appendix largely involves repeated tables of results/data and the complete survey instrument. We mainly want the evaluators to focus on the methodology of the study design, the approach to presenting the results, the statistical analysis (or lack thereof), and the high level inferences and implications drawn from the evidence collected. The evaluators could also weigh in on the particular x-risk areas that they may have expertise in, considering whether these were presented meaningfully.
“Background & motivation” ... (for a lay audience)
“Comparing experts to superforecasters” (for a lay audience)
Results — a lot of space in the main text is devoted to graphing and tabling these differences, along with the same notes each time. This can go quickly.
“How the XPT results compare to prior risk estimates” — this  section is less in need of methodological expert evaluation (although experts on these particular risk areas might be consulted to check if the sources are reputable and authoritative)
“Contrasting experts and superforecasters in different domains” largely recaps what we saw/heard before, with some layman’s explanation
Questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks — interesting but may not benefit from expert evaluation (but see question above)
“Relationships between risk predictions in different domains” — this seems to involve some ad-hoc descriptive statistics ... not sure how useful these are to pore over, if there are no real implications here.
“How time spent thinking about existential risk relates to forecasts of those risks” (obvious/boring IMO)
“Individual risk areas” — each evaluator could read/skim through two of these. (Evaluators with particular expertise on these risk areas should also comment on the appropriateness of the discussion and framing).","

My conversation with Ezra Karger, notes

I’m taking some notes in hypothes.is (here)
",,,,,"David Manheim,Anca Hanea",7,47 days,,,,,"DR: 50% (about at the median of our evaluations) I see substance and high-level suggestions here. I’d like to see the evaluator go into a bit more detail, with specific suggestions and critiques though. Particularly in their area of expertise, involving persuasion. Anca Hanea What do you think? 
NB, a quick link to the evaluation is here. It’s a pdf and we prefer the raw files, so we need to reach out to the evaluator for this anyway.  Anca, would you want to write to them to ask for a little bit of followup? They indicated a willingness to evaluate a revised version, so they have some willingness to followup (although we are a bit vague about compensation on this). 
",,"DR: Note it’s a 751 page pdf (only about 75 pages up to the bibliography, about 22k words); perhaps they have a better web interface; we would need to consider how to have it evaluated.
DR: I’m going to consider it in our ‘nonacademic stream’ perhaps; it’s going to target academia at some point, but I don’t think the current version could be assessed in that way
GT: I voted no because I thought that 750 pages was too big for us to meaningfully evaluate with our current procedure. But looking back, I see that the main body of the report is only goes to page 75, and about 500 pages is appendix 7. So as long as we don’t expect anybody to go through the appendices in detail it seems ambitious but possible for an evaluator.
For these long reports (also Matt’s Returns to Science one) I think we might want to give evaluators some specific guidelines about what to cover, rather than just going through everything as they might for a peer review(I’m not sure sure how academic book publishers do peer review any differently from journal publishers, but I assume their mandate is usually to cover everything)
DR: I agree Gavin. I propose
We have it evaluated as a non-academic-stream output.
We carefully limit which aspects/sections we ask evaluators to consider
I think scoping this out and evaluating managing this will be considerable work. So I’m thinking that I’ll both look for an evaluation manager (maybe paying a little extra) and help them by doing a lot of this work myself.

Incorporating from comments
I spoke with Ezra, he is cooperative

DR: Reading the paper
From what I’m seeing, there’s a real lack of formal technical content. Even though the paper is very long in pages, its a lot of repetition, simple background for a lay audience, and repeated presentations of tables of results and question instruments (~putting all the data into a pdf :)).
I think we should be able to identify a limited set of issues the evaluators could focus on.

Samara: This is a topic I think about a lot but don’t necessarily work on, so I don’t know how relevant the paper is for my work (or others). However, there are a few things in the paper that would be interesting to evaluate further.
In terms of the topic, I think there’s a wide interest in concentration in the meat industry. But I have some open questions that may imply the topic isn’t very relevant to people’s work:
To what degree can animal advocates/EAs affect the concentration of the animal agriculture industry?
To what degree is concentration more harmful than diffusion for non-human animals? I’ve been wondering this for a long time, and I’m not totally sure (and there’s only a little research on it). It seems to be mostly bad for humans, so I suspect on net it’s more harmful, but maybe I’m wrong or at least wrong in the case of animal welfare. I guess this is an argument for more research into the overall effects of concentration-reducing policies, but that’s not really the point of this paper.
If you think the topic is relevant, I think there are some details worth examining in the paper.
Did the authors conduct any sensitivity analysis on the demand elasticity parameter (they don’t report it), and if so what were the results?  There are a few reasons that I could believe that their choice of demand elasticity was hasty, but it may not change their conclusions much.
This might be outside the scope of the evaluation process, but I’m curious what might the theoretical model look like with a different definition of resilience? Specifically, one that included some measure of animal welfare and non-consumer human welfare as they’re affected by these exogenous events and subsequent closures (like the mass livestock cullings that happened in early 2020 as a result of plant closures, or plant worker stress associated with having to work extra hours during the pandemic in plants that didn’t close). This might all fall under the welfare analysis section (i.e., including animals in the social welfare function, or adding cost of worker injury/illness, etc) or it might need a overhaul of the theory model. I didn’t look to hard at that model.
Looking more closely at all of the (many) assumptions throughout the paper could be warranted.
My question about concentration/market power and animal welfare generally revolves around the factors you mentioned: political influence, stocking density, worker training, access to health care, etc. There’s some work on it, but I don’t have strong sense of the net harm to animals from concentration.
It seems the demand elasticity point is the most tractable for review, and also probably the easiest to just email the authors lol … instead of conducting a full evaluation.",,Markets for products with large externalities (focus: animal agriculture),Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,01_Needs prioritization/assessor rating,"DR: I really want to have us evaluate some work in the meat industry space because of its relevance to animal welfare.

I liked this article.
KG: I also liked this. I think it has interesting ramifications on long-run scientific progress, and I wonder if there’s a way of framing AI alignment in the early stages of this, which may have spillovers. I don’t think it’s a standard economics paper, and I think my confidence intervals on this paper are pretty wide but I’ve put a high percentage here despite this
GT: To be honest, despite all the attention, this got, it reads more like a policy paper than empirical research to me. There seem to be a lot of analogies used to describe their model of effort vs. impact, but the only data is in Fig. 7, to support their claim that novelty is weakly correlated with citations (I do like the fact they are measuring novelty with a textual analysis). I feel that most of the effort in an evaluation would be to check that their sources/analogies actually do support their model and then provides sufficient justification for their proposals - overall this seems like it will be quite subjective.
DR: Gave it a quick skim. Looked like anecdotes + very toy model + opinion + maybe a very quick empirical exercise (which could have been interesting if they had gone into more detail).
This does seem interesting for our own consideration of prioritization – do they give any formal measurable definition of ‘scientific impact’, though?
My impression is also that, even though these are ‘NBER authors’ this was not a fully-baked effort.","Overall I feel this has been an influential and catchy article, and it may have gotten more attention than it deserved given the apparent low level of rigour. That said, I’m not sure if the main structure of the article (mostly anecdote and opinion) really lends it’s to the Unjournal style of assessment, as it would just be evaluators opinions of the authors opinions. I would not recommend evaluating this if it as published, but if it will be a long-lived working paper I would put it in as a second-tier priority.

I [Rosie] am hugely grateful to the reviewers for their time and expertise, and agree with many (though not all) of their comments. For context, these guidelines are not a published paper, but are WIP internal guidelines that we use at FP to estimate internal and external validity rankings across different RCTs. I'm especially pleased that Unjournal chose to review it, as it is often difficult to get reviews of this style of work
I unfortunately can't engage more at present without dropping on really high-priority work, but I hope to respond more fully in the next few months; I am keen to find and test different methods of estimating effect size inflation and Type S error. I would view it as a hugely positive thing if the reviewers (or other readers) have uncovered superior ways of estimating these metrics—especially methods that are practical for time-pressured decision and policy-makers.

>  Specifically, when a treated firm committed a violation, citizen volunteers who cooperated with our experiment filed an appeal through one of two broadly-defined channels: (1) private appeals where the citizens complained to the regulator or the firm about the violation in ways that could not be observed by other members of the public; (2) public appeals where the citizens complained about the violation on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform that is comparable to Twitter. In total, the experiment intervened against nearly 3,000 pollution violations.
> Specifically, we randomized the
visibility of social media appeals about a violation by experimentally adding 10 additional “likes” and “shares” to the Weibo post, which would otherwise obtain 0.66 “likes” and “shares” naturally.
> if anything, the interventions might have created positive spillover effects. For example, the relative probability of a violation was either unchanged or lower among the control and treatment firms in the higher intensity prefectures, although the reduced violation rates are not always statistically significant by conventional criteria

1. Is there any actionable intervention here? Can China/outsiders/NGOs do anything to encourage or facilitate this sort of citizen participation? Would any ‘intervention’ in this case backfire if the government were aware of this?

 I think that it would be good to have 
(1) an expert in text analysis;
 (2) an expert in measuring company performance indicators; and 
(3) someone who has done something like this paper but for climate change/other ESG measures. 
He is also concerned to get perspectives on financial measures from mainstream econ/finance researchers from outside the “ESG impacts on financial returns” subfield/focal area 
In discussion with david reinstein it was decided to prioritise #1 and #2. We may later consider whether a referee fitting #3 would be useful",,,"Ben Balmford chatGPT made a few suggestions that seemed reasonable:
Jillian Grennan  adjunct assoc. professor,  research active, seems to do some actual corporate finance stuff, GPT claims “Grennan specializes in employing innovative computational techniques to quantify corporate culture, sustainability, and diversity, equity, and inclusion objectives, utilizing machine learning and natural language processing.”

Elizabeth Demers “An Associate Professor of Accounting at the University of Virginia, Demers specializes in financial reporting and analysis, with a focus on how company disclosures affect investor perceptions and company performance. Her empirical research methods and expertise in analyzing financial statements and performance indicators would be highly relevant.” → accepted → later backed out. 

Dragan Ilic “An Assistant Professor at the University of Basel, Ilić's work in the intersection of finance and sustainability, with a focus on quantitative methods and empirical finance, could `provide insights into measuring company performance with respect to biodiversity risks.”
Stephanie F. Cheng “Assistant Professor of Accounting at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Her research interests include using textual analysis to understand corporate disclosures and investor responses.”
GPT also suggested Harrison Hong. A long shot, but if he’s a nice person, he might at least have some suggestions.

I also looked through our volunteer evaluators database, but nothing sprang up. I couldn’t find a lot of expertise on the corporate finance/asset pricing/event studies side. 
Hmm... maybe Paul Smeets (a good friend and collaborator) would have some suggestions for this. He runs a whole ‘center for sustainable finance’, but he is very much a skeptical/critical thinker on this. 

Ben Balmford  Paul Smeets suggested Julian Kolbel — I took a look, and I agree (see, e.g., “Do investors care about impact?“). If we still need evaluators, maybe reach out to Julian, and mention Paul suggested him?
When we ask these people, let’s also remember to request their suggestions for other potential evaluators

david reinstein thanks for this, it is much appreciated. I think what I will do is write to Paul and someone else I have found (called Allen Huang) off my personal email address with you in CC (so as to avoid the spam-y look problem). I am then also going away next Wed for 4.5 weeks - the first 2 are leave and I wont have access to email during that time, the second 2.5 I should have occassional access, so if something needs doing during that time (ie emailing people that they suggest, or sending official puppub invites) would you be ok to do that?

FWIW, Yoon Kim at MIT also looked like someone with expertise in large language models (although much less knowledge about the finance side of things)

",,,,,,,7,47 days,,,,,"DR Ben Balmford At a quick read, it seemed like a strong and detailed evaluation. Shows a careful reading of the paper. Some substantive technical discussion an critiques. Also seems to consider our ratings carefully.  Less strong in terms of considering tangible policy implications IMO: why should ‘biodiversity risk priced into assets’ cause market forces to limit these risks?  And what’s the actual policy response either way?

I’d say it’s about 85th percentile (i.e., top 15th percentile) of the evaluations we get.  

BB:
Hi. Quality of evaluation - yes, a very decent one. Interesting that it doesnt criticise the measure at all, almost accepts that if there is co-movement it must be picking up something real (true) but does not critique that that something real might not actually be biodiversity, but rather broader environmental issues.

On policy: I am not really sure what I think the policy response necessarily is. For sure, there needs to be better reg[ulation] of the standards associated with ESG style finance (it is a wild west ATM where each ratings-agency-like-body will give very different ratings allowing people to shop around + suggesting the standards are capturing very little of the signal).
DR: And that’s even assuming ESG ratings make a difference
Second, my personal view is that biodiversity (and climate to a lesser extent) risks/opportunities are actually so far off (and therefore hard to predict at the firm level) that actually they should not broadly be being priced in at the moment. Moreover, exposed to risk =/= doing the damage, so even if priced in, there are equity concerns. Both of which are really arguments for govt involvement in the regulation of the damage - the argument which broadly says that esg investing will solve this is unlikely to hold

",,"Seems more about the finance aspects of it and whether the markets predict this risk (TO: and also, is more about using the news as a proxy for real biodiversity risk (and this may be different from media-reported biodiversity losses))

Moved from ‘comments’ on Airtable version: 
some discussion about useability of pubpub, need for author approval. It’s all good now
DR nagging Ben to invite more reviewers
We moved forward with Paul’s suggestion (Julian Kolbel)
DR pushed forward and invited more people, we now have 2 accepted evaluators","BBalmford: I actually think that this paper might be a whole lot more impactful than your suggesting, David. Basically, the paper explores the impact of whether a company’s 10K filing includes mention of exposure to biodiversity risks or not, and then what happens to their equity pricing as there is a shock (“bad news”) regarding the salience of biodiversity out in the wider world. TO: the topic is super important, but I am not convinced by the argument that news reports OR contents of the 10K filing can be used as proxies (or alternatives) for real biodiversity impact. Non-newsworthy biodiversity events won’t be covered by the media, and won’t shape sharegholder perceptions. Of course, financial risk is affected by media coverage and public perceptions, but this in itself doesnt feel particularly ground-breaking. I’m not very enamoured with this piece unfortunately…
On the impactful side, the idea that ESG-like ratings, and disclosures related to environmental risk are going to shift allocations of capital at huge scales, and help address the biodiversity (and climate) crisis, is a pervasive idea within policy making and investment circles, and to a lesser extent for conservation scientists too. Indeed, that is what a whole heap of ratings agencies are focused on being able to quantify, and why there is the taskforce for nature related financial disclosures.
I’d probably put myself at the very sceptical end of all this, mainly because I think that there is very little industries can do to protect themselves against the risks, any improvements they make to the underling biodiversity are public goods, and the firms reliant on biodiversity are not the same ones that are going to be doing harm to it. Nonetheless, evidence on this is likely to be extremely impactful in shaping views on whether this does or does not work, and this paper is (I suspect) going to publish very well and start to underpin that evidence base, like we have seen for carbon/climate related disclosures.
Downsides of this paper: 1) this can really be seen a shift (biodiversity in the news) -share (biodiversity mentioned in 10k filings) style causal identification. I’m generally a bit sceptical of this style of identification, but that may well just be my bias. 2) I think there is an awful lot of over-identification of biodiversity related terms within their dataset (eg “ecosystem” or “marine” being used in non-biodiversity related context a lot); may result in attenuation bias I think. 3) on the impact side, the paper is (at least to me) somewhat inconclusive as to the implications for biodiversity.

How should we think about the study when n = 51? (and why does the sample size change across a substantial subset of the questions?), (2) interpretation of the results, especially when considered through some kind of economic lens: what are the trade-offs involved in adopting some practices? what are likely costs vs. benefits of the policies, and what does high agreement imply about them (benefits outweigh the costs? or is it a statement about magnitude of expected benefit)? Is it a statement about the riskiness of a given action? What should labs prioritize when time/money/human capital is constrained?, and (3) what further work in this space could look like: where is expert opinion likely to be most credible and helpful?

Is quantifying “how bad natural disasters are bad for long term growth, and that they will become more common” really going to have an even marginal effect on climate policy? I somewhat doubt it. I guess broadly I am fairly skeptical, but I don’t think the reason climate policy looks like it does is because we have underestimated the cost side of CC, even if that estimated cost is large (ie it is the externality issue, motivating self interested countries to do nothing). Also, on the cost side, I would expect that the discount rate used has a much larger effect than this.

There is substantial debate over the effectiveness of deworming relative to other impactful interventions like bednets. Evidence for the effectiveness of deworming, seems to be far more uncertain with much greater confidence intervals than for other interventions. Previous work, particular, focusing on the long-term impact, seems to be inconsistent, or in some cases seemed face-value implausible. See fairly non-technical discussions:

This is a very detailed paper in an important area, with a large fairly senior and prominent team, and I believe it is informing an influential debate.  The evaluation content mainly consists of a few requests for clarification to the authors, and noting that certain information appears to be missing.  I suspect that some of these stem from a misreading or misunderstanding, e.g., 
The authors also mention excluding from the treatment group participants who were also involved in other cross-cutting experiments. However the authors did not do similarly for the control group. Why? 
Perhaps more explanation is needed, but the authors do explain why they did this and how they re-weight to deal with it. 
The evaluator's ratings (slider bars) also suggest some misunderstanding here. E.g., they give a midpoint of the 10th percentile for nearly all of these, without anything to explain why they think this research seems to be so limited.  I know you suggested that 3ie found some limitations in this work, but this evaluation doesn't really explain the nature of these limitations.
Would you be willing to write to the evaluator to ask them to provide more?  Or do you think it would make more sense to ask for a third evaluator instead?

"," UBI has been talked about quite extensively in policy circles as well, and this paper [has the potential to contribute to] the evidence on its effects in developing country contexts. [Note, the authors]  are only reporting short-term results for the current study. ...Already featured on a website that provides policy evidence on UBI. 
Also, the paper was discussed HERE on the EA Forum
","The paper presents an important (and impressive) randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the impact of different timing structures of unconditional cash transfers (or universal basic income) in Kenya.​ There are two important aspects of the paper that make it suitable for evaluation at the Unjournal: the first is the clear linkage to global priorities research and the fact that the authors include individuals from GiveDirectly, an NGO providing UCTs globally and generating an evidence-based approach for giving. The second is that from a knowledge perspective, the findings need to be critically evaluated to better understand what we can learn from RCTs on UBI in the context of Kenya. Given that RCTs are typically considered the “gold standard” of evidence (not just in economics or policy research, but increasingly among policy stakeholders in the Global South). 
The study compares three arms: a lump sum transfer, a UBI over two years, and a two-year transfer with the promise of ten years of additional transfers. ​ Each participant received $3,000 in transfers over the study period, with the long-term arm expecting an additional $15,000. ​ The RCT aims to understand how the timing of transfers affects the outcomes, such as work behavior and investment decisions. As Evaluator 1 points out, the study's scale is noteworthy, with nearly 23,000 treated adults and a cost of approximately USD 70 million, making it more comparable to a government program than a standard economics RCT. ​ The findings have implications for policymakers designing benefit structures and organizations like GiveDirectly, who routinely produce evidence at varied levels that could also serve as avenues for future evaluation of applied work at the Unjournal. Evaluating this paper, therefore, gives us an opportunity to better situate such policy evidence in the context of other similar work at GiveDirectly and other non-profits. 
Both evaluations agree that the work is likely to make a critical impact on what works in poverty reduction or alleviation within the realm of development economics. The second evaluation especially highlights some of the concerns around causal inference from the claims made by the authors, and provides useful insights on how best to consider these. In particular, the claims around the effects of UBI on well-being and consumption merit some more careful explanation of mechanisms — perhaps the authors could use some aspects of program design (e.g., access to mental health services etc.) to decompose these effects. There are also many other useful comments from the second evaluator on what the authors could meaningfully consider for improving the paper either as part of the current project itself or as future work.
","David R.: E.g., do we want someone good at modeling of labor provision and investment in low income countries,  familiarity with the literature on cash transfers and UBI experiments, the Kenya environment, the construction derived average treatment effects with interactions, etc.?
AT: Ideally, one evaluator who may be able to comment on the policy side of studying UBI in the developing country context (perhaps even with some past experience with Kenya), and another evaluator who will be able to comment on the experimental design and causal inference aspects of the paper.
",,"Anirudh Tagat  — Florian Habermacher (on our FS team) suggested he would be very interested in being an evaluator for this. “I've worked quite a bit on UBI questions, written some of the more down-to-earth analysis on some implementations foreseen”
We don't have a strictly  policy on when we will reach out to internal people. It's certainly not a complete prohibition, but we also don't want to be a bubble. In the past as you know we've done this where in need. In theproposed COI doc I wrote:

Members of our team who did not suggest the paper as evaluators:  We will slightly favor choosing evaluators who are not members of The Unjournal’s team; however, this is not a strong consideration; members of our team generally serve as only one of four or more votes to prioritize a paper.","Following the discussion on Slack, it might be good to keep Nathan (who suggested the paper) as backup and scout for other evaluators who would be able to speak to this paper. As discussed above, considering someone who has past work in Kenya and broadly studying labor.

Anirudh Tagat I believe the second listed evaluator is Shobit K. He is one of our field specialists. That’s OK, but we will need to remember to note this in the output as per our COI policies. 

Also, he told me he was overloaded on evaluation management. I wonder if he will be able to make the deadline for this — worth checking in with him.
David Reinstein: I was hoping to hear from Shobhit, but since it has been a while I have gone ahead and invited Florian.

AT: The first evaluation provides a broad overview of the policy importance of universal cash transfers / universal basic income, which the paper studies using an RCT. It is a helpful contextualization of where such evidence might be useful, but also what might be some of the key factors to consider in weighing this evidence alongside others for policymakers. Since the evaluation did not come from an academic economist, it is reasonably light on methodological issues, but it is otherwise quite sound in terms of policy contexts. 
Ranking: 65th percentile
DR: Fair points. But I would have liked to see a bit more careful critique of the claims and limitations of the work.","Note
AT: The second evaluation is a well structured and detailed deep-dive into the paper and the claims made by the authors. I found it to be a very compelling read. The flow of looking at each claim separately and pointing out some key methodological, econometric, and other concerns is excellent and makes it even more useful for authors (and other readers) to consider. It is characteristic of the type of detailed comments that authors might see at a top economics journal.
Ranking: 95th percentile

Anirudh Tagat  Right, we are waiting to hear back from them. They said “we're planning to post an updated version in the fairly near future (which is also the version we'd plan to submit to academic journals) so my suggestion would be to wait and look at that, though of course entirely up to you.”  You asked for followup on this, eight days ago.

JJ:
I found the internal list of potential evaluators (which seems good to stick with if possible, since they have expressed interest) -
DR:
Thanks Julian Jamison Internal list — we do try to prioritize this, but we typically end up going off-list to get the relevant expertise.  We also need to promote signing up for this better, and curate the list better natural (lots of natural scientists, non-researchers etc) ... something I’m working on.  
JJ: 
“should I be trying to avoid asking people who already have assignments?” 

DR: 
in principle yes,  but that’s not likely to be a big problem at the moment. There’s no super-easy way to check for this now (I can do it but I need to make it easier for others)  — that’s something we should work on. Davit Jintcharadze and I plan to do a better job of maintaining, curating, and linking the evaluator content here in the Coda soon. But for now, don’t worry about that. 

JJ:
Also I noticed that e.g. Michael Wiebe / Robert Kubinec / Mattie Toma were considered along with me as EMs for this one (if I’m reading it correctly?), who do seem like very good fits, so would it make sense just to start with say two of them?
DR: 
Our general policy is to try to seek evaluators outside of our team first, and then look inside our team if it seems like it’s higher value. The thinking: we generally don’t want to be an echo chamber, and we ~don’t want the same people to both select/prioritize and evaluate the paper. That said, I see pros and cons here, and we don’t rule out people on our team being the evaluators. 


JJ:
All this makes sense - maybe I should have first asked what exactly it meant to see Michael / Robert / Mattie in the list for this paper? I had interpreted that as “other people who were considered for the EM role, but who hadn’t been involved with choosing or prioritizing this particular paper” (since that was my own position). I agree probably best to avoid the latter group also being the evaluators unless absolutely necessary, but it didn’t seem like that applied here... ? [I get that they are still part of the ‘internal team’ however]

DR: 
Yeah I think that’s mostly right. 
We chose them (or you) as potential evaluation managers 
We usually don’t want to choose the person who originally suggested the paper as the EM, but it’s sometimes OK as long as others have had a say as well and endorsed it
These people are also ‘on our team’, so they still had some role in prioritizing the paper etc. There’s a slight preference for finding someone from outside our team to be the evaluator, but it’s not an overwhelming preference

See our suggested COI policies here, especially the table of roles. For this pairing  (member of team & evaluator) I noted “OK but not ideal. Report.”
JJ:
So my task is: suggest (and then contact via PubPub) two relevant evaluators, starting by considering people on the existing list (but not from the Unjournal team itself) and going beyond that as/if needed.

DR: 
yes, you don’t need to prioritize the existing list too much, just a little. 

Please contact them via pubpub we also advise sending another email from your own address as PubPub has a tendency to go to the spam box.

And you can ‘overbook’ a little bit; say, invite 3 or 4 if you only need 2, as response rates are fairly low. (We usually get a yes from about 1 in 4 or 1 in 5; higher if it’s people you have connection to, of course)","Kris Gulati you mentioned “dig into the empirics to ensure it’s robust” — any issues to flag in particular?
",,,,,,,47 days,,,,,"DR: Julian Jamison I just noticed evaluation 1 was in. If you like, you could give feedback on it now, and even an assessment of ‘where the quality of evaluation ranks as a percentile relative to our general pool.’  We do this both to inform ‘who gets bonuses and prizes’. Also to let us know if the evaluators need to be consulted again to clarify or improve their work. And if the evaluations are less than adequate we usually add a third evaluator.  I have not read it yet, but a small comment is that I’d encourage the evaluator to reconsider their ratings , considering their uncertainty in a more Bayesian way, and look at the rating a bit more carefully 
In  particular, they gave a “0” with a CI “0,0” for ‘where should this be published’. As you know a Bayesian posterior (under some general conditions) never converges to absolute certainty. 
The midpoint “0” also seems dubious; not because I have any particular reason to think this paper  is very good (or bad), but because if you look at how we consider the journal tier and the examples we give, even tier 1 is a pretty low standard. 
At a glance it looks like a substantive evaluation, at least :). 
Ah wait, I now see this is an evaluation by a member of our team, and he has access to this data. So let’s not rate him, and we can discuss it with him less formally.
",,"DR: I skimmed this; I’m almost ready to give the go-ahead but I have some doubts (I’m not including doubts about the research methods/quality itself per se, because we decided that within the space of ‘influential/prestigious work on impactful topics’ this would not be a factor for prioritization).Some (related) concerns:
Is it truly influential? Is it likely to be considered by policymakers and foundations allocating funds? (Even as an indirect/second consideration in terms of the ‘nature of projects to fund’)
Are there clear policy implications of this?
Does the nature of their empirical results (if deemed credible) yield insights for policy and allocations?
If there are no further comments, I’m leaning towards having it evaluated. While the policy implications are not super-obvious, I can see this informing educational and psychological interventions and curricula (e.g., ‘abundance mentality’ coaching’).

 I worked with Monica Jain on a systematic review about childhood education. Monica leads work with GAVI and COVAX and has a background in economics. . . but, I am not quite sure why that would be relevant as it seems an epidemiologist would be more in line. Still, Monica could be a good bet or might know someone who is.

DR: This seems very relevant in terms of impact but it’s mainly epidemiological – is that in our wheelhouse?
DR, responding to others’ comments – OK, I’m going to push this forward to ‘looking for evaluation manager’ but we can put some asterisks on this one that we are proceeding tentatively, and only if we seem able to find good evaluators with relevant expertise in epidemiology etc.
Note I pushed this forward even though it’s ‘average final rating’ was below 4.0 because it ticks so many of our boxes (author submitted, open science, cuts across important causes and priorities) it allows us to learn about ‘whether we can handle this type of paper’ I suspect that some of your ratings would have been higher ‘conditional on us finding good epi evaluators’

Michael Wiebe Given your work on the “measles paper”, I was wondering if you think you/we could handle ‘evaluation managing’ this (note the concerns about it’s epidemiological focus). Perhaps we could get some guidance or cooperation from the authors of that paper, or maybe from people like Carl Bonander
","JG: My take is that it’s probably worth evaluating if you can find someone with sufficient domain experience to be able to provide rigorous scrutiny, and I worry that that may be challenging. For instance, from a glance through, it seems to me that a major weakness of this paper’s approach, given the other features of the model it uses, might be that it doesn’t allow for heterogeneous mixing by age, but I think you’d need someone with substantial past experience developing COVID-19 models to get a clear intuition about how sensitive we should expect the results to be to that restriction.
I don’t really think that there are health economists (in the American sense of the term) doing cutting-edge applied research in infectious disease modeling. There are some econometricians who have contributed to improving ID modeling methods, like Victor Chernozhukov, but I very seriously doubt that he’d be interested in evaluating this for you.

From The Unjournal’s prioritization assessor: 
This report develops a quantitive model of the returns of bioscience [and biotech] in the presence of catastrophic risks. The modelling is based on estimates from superforecasters and domain experts in Tetlock’s Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament and integrates various existential risk concepts (e.g. time of perils). ... the results are used to provide metascience policy advice.
The report finds that the expected social returns of bioscience research are x230 compared to cash transfers (to middle-class Americans?). However, this is offset by a small (~5%) extinction risk. The overall conclusion of the report ... may reassure EAs concerned who advocate for slowing down bioscience research to mitigate GCBRs, and influence the investments such EAs make in biorisk reduction. 
This question seems of obvious policy importance, given the tremendous amount of government and charitable finding for science especially biotech, and given prominently expressed doubts about this, citing catastrophic risks.
This report influenced Open Philanthropy, a major funder, and may influence them in the future
This is an internal report Matt Clancy, head of Open Philanthropy’s Innovation Policy Program (IPP).  OP was broadly considering whether they, (through IPP&  perhaps more broadly) should support the advancement of science and technology. 
According to Matt, the report was an important input into their decision (among others?).  He says that through this report and broader discussion, they adopted a moderate position on ‘whether to support advancing tech’, in between two poles.
Positive pole: ‘full steam ahead, accelerate science, remove bottlenecks’
Negative pole: advancements are very dangerous. Try to steer it, don’t try to accelerate it; maybe try to slow some areas.
The ‘middle’  position they adopted:  IPP will do some of both, but perhaps more towards the positive pole (if I understood him correctly)
OP is influential, and their opinions may influence other funders and policymakers
","Unjournal requests 
Consider the choice of discount rates carefully; 
e.g., see the discussions of this on the EA forum here
Does the author fairly characterize his modeling results?
The author states the conclusion something like 
If we ignore “civilization-ending catastrophes” the benefits outweigh forecasted risks under a robust set of plausible assumptions. [Is this truly the case?] 
Considering “civilization-ending catastrophes”/X-risk,  the benefit - cost is not clear, it critically depends on:
which risk estimates are used (see the difference between Tetlock’s superforecasters and experts) 
and (perhaps) on reasonable disagreements about how much value is placed on the long-term future.
[Is it really contingent on these things, or is it actually much more to one side or the other?]
[This was more the ‘author’s take at the end iirc] “Fortunately for us, estimates of how likely this is to occur are small enough that, for the most part, it shouldn’t loom large in our thinking about the value of science; especially if we are actively seeking to reduce those dangers.”
[Is this a fair characterization of what the modeling actually finds?] 
Bonus: Extending this analysis to AI risks 
This is an obvious follow-up, and it would be interesting (although perhaps difficult) for an evaluator to consider how feasible this is based on the current model and the tournament predictions.
Author’s requests, endorsed by The Unjournal
Vetting the calculations and the code. 
Ultimately, no one has vetted the calculations or the code.  At least one evaluator should pour through and audit at least some part of the calculations and the code. Matt thinks this could be high-value. “Any economist could do it.” 
There are two models, one  is derived ‘by hand’ … the equations are in the appendix.  The second model is in a Python program. Shareable … just sums a bunch of cohorts, discounts them, etc..  
Uncertainty: You can choose parameters … but I guess no distributions over these. You can tinker with these in the Google Sheet model.
 “The questions about tech diffusion”
Matt suggests he sees the most value from considering this carefully. Model treats it as simultaneous with (lags?) on the bounds on technology. Is this reasonable and justified in this situation? How robust are the results to this?

 I fleshed out some of the content here (see above). We have some definite ideas about who/what/how/why to evaluate this. Next I hope to read the paper itself in more detail. But let’s push on with this once you have the bandwidth.

Joel: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?
What question needs to be asked by when?
There's a lot of information scattered in different emails, pages, messages, comments. Can we stick to one single communication channel, e.g. only by email or only in this comment thread?

DR: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?” Joel Christoph I’m not sure if you are asking a broad or a narrow question here. I discuss this on our page here in a general sense. For the ’policy stream’, the main goals are the first and third ones mentioned there.

“Crafting evaluations and ratings that help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research. For Research Users.”

“Providing constructive feedback to Authors”

In the boxes above, I raise some specific issues I would like evaluators to consider above, and Matt also raised some

What question needs to be asked by when?
Not sure what you are asking here.  We give the evaluators autonomy. However, we do make recommendations.I guess that’s what we need to decide now. Which questions should evaluators tackle, and how should we  divide this between the evaluators. Of course that depends on the expertise and interests of the evaluators we manage to get.. 
Joel and David had a face to face chat on this. 
JC noted:
1. I share your concerns about the length and formatting potentially deterring our evaluators. Let's narrow our focus further or ask Matt to streamline the document to clearly delineate the sections for each evaluator and highlight the essential parts our focus.
2. I note that we are evaluating this paper to help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research AND to provide constructive feedback to the author.

DR: Joel Christoph I moved this paper back to ‘awaiting author update’ based on the recent response from Matt Clancy, until we hear from him or decide to move forward
On March Matt proposed a delay “a month or two” for some updates (proposed on May 8, not sure how long the delay is).  Checkin date April 25?
Update 25 April — Matt promised a new version would be up in 2 weeks.

Update May 9 — Matt shared a new version. Joel Christoph let’s move forward on this.
","This report develops a quantitive model of the returns of bioscience in the presence of catastrophic risks caused by bioweapons. The modelling is based on estimates from superforecasters and domain experts in Tetlock’s Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament and integrates various existential risk concepts (e.g. time of perils). It seems well-thought-out and carefully discussed (particularly about comparing the predictions from superforecasters and experts, which differ substantially), and the results are used to provide metascience policy advice.
The report finds that the expected social returns of bioscience research are x230 compared to cash transfers (to a ~middle-class Americans). However, this is offset by a small (~5%) extinction risk. The overall conclusion of the report is that funding bioscience is good, and as this seems to be the ‘business as usual’ perspective for science funders, it seems unlikely to have much mainstream policy influence. However, it may reassure EAs concerned who advocate for slowing down bioscience research to mitigate GCBRs, and influence the investments such EAs make in biorisk reduction. In particular, the discussion notes that it may be best to view accelerating research and mitigating technological risks as separate objectives (evaluating the evidence for this claim in more detail seems important), which may be useful for guiding EAs investing bioscience research.
As an OP report (that relies heavily on forecaster estimates) this may not be submitted to a journal for standard peer review. The report is rather long and detailed, it may be a big ask for somebody to evaluate carefully.

I am not particularly familiar with/active in this area of research.
The paper is not prominent or influential, and the author is a PhD student. Thus I consider it’s potential for impact and it’s apparent methodological strength.
I did not consider the author’s likely engagement, as we are not meant to note this here. This could be an overriding factor – if they are willing to engage, this might meet the bar
Apparent positives:
If the implied claims are true that ~‘this (arguably? under some conditions?) equivalent policy framing will lead to much greater support for a carbon pricing policy’, the impact is huge. My impression is that the ‘penalty and reward’ system could be implementable in the real world, although it might be harder to calibrate it. The multi-stage experimental agenda appears rigorous and possibly well-implemented.
Apparent limitations:
Paper is a bit overwordy and hard to read. Explanations are hard to follow.
Overclaims/Overstates some things … e.g., the Prolific ‘representative on some demographics’ is not a ‘nationally representative sample’
Preregistration is mentioned but no link or connection is given.
Could have done more to connect to policymakers/real world policies","The Environment: Harm to human health, biodiversity, risks and climate change",Carbon pricing and bounded reasoning,02_final consideration needed,"This paper explores a switch from the classic style of revenue-neutral externality tax (charge marginal cost on all units consumed, distribute this back evenly across all those who are taxed) to one in which people receive a reward (pay a fee) for all units consumed below (above) some threshold quantity. He shows that the general public struggles to understand the implications of a traditional tax set up, particularly that they don’t believe it’ll effect consumption behaviour and they don’t think they’ll be benefitted by the policy. He demonstrates in a pay-off relevant experiment that this is from cognitive biases regarding the dividend that is received from the total pot, and shows that the switch to the reward and penalty structure leads to much greater support amongst the general public across the political spectrum.
Considering the downsides, I have some reservations about the design, in the sense that the respondents could see it as saying which of these do you prefer, rather than do you support the policy at all vs the status quo. For the impact, it seems it might be limited because the key switch is poorly explained, and simplified language in the explanation of the cognitive bias and how this is addressed would be helpful. It is also unclear how much this changes the dial on externality tax acceptance, Vs say moving from revenue generating to revenue neutral tax. Finally, it seems to me that the proposed approach is going to more costly to implement than a “normal” tax – normal tax could be applied to producers, where the proposed penalty and reward could not be.

There seem to be agreement among economists that a carbon tax (or equivalent) is all we need to solve climate change. Surprisingly, there is little empirical evidence. In 2019, Julius Andersson provided what was framed as first credible evidence in a paper in AEJ:Policy, with data from Sweden. This new paper is very similar, showing the effect of a carbon tax in Finland, which was the first country to implement such a tax in 1990. The paper uses the synthetic control method and would benefit from a true expert in the method in the evaluation. Although the paper is fairly simple and similar to Andersson (2019), it is still one of very few addressing the huge empirical question on the effect of carbon taxes on emissions.

GT: “Ben Jones replied and said they are currently rewriting it and asked us to wait for a new draft. They seemed fairly positive about engaging with the process. ... They suggested we get back in contact for an update during summer. I set a reminder to touch base with them at the start of July.”
DR: Mentioned the ‘interim evaluation’ approach but GT didn’t think the authors would be interested 

","I have mixed feelings on the paper:
Positives: novel, interesting and arguably counter-intuitive results which have wider implications
Negatives: focus on Covid where a lot of things were happening so it’s like a case study (but that should be part of the evaluation)
Overall: I think it would be interesting to see it evaluated.","Innovation, meta-science, and research",Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,03_awaiting authors' consent (where needed) or imminent update,This seems like quite a well-designed study referenced against a specific event (COVID) and broader publishing trends.,Kris Gulati,Gavin Taylor,Gavin Taylor,,prominent,2024-06-04T00:00:00.000-04:00,,,Contact authors about new draft,Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,70%,80%,75%,Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,,Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,,"Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science,Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science",2024-07-01T00:00:00.000-04:00,

Also, it’s relatively recent, follows open principles, and I think that Gary submitted it for evaluation.","Innovation, meta-science, and research",Improving Peer Review in Economics: Stocktaking and Proposals∗,02_final consideration needed,"Charness seems interested.

Is it essentially because ‘this is something with a large scale that affects the global economy’, or is there a connection to catastrophic risks or something?
DR: Deprioritizing – the ratings are below the bar, and I don’t see the obvious case that this is first-order a global priority. Maybe return to it later if there is strong interest.","I think this covers some important aspects of things UJ can prioritize, especially since it deals with firm-level innovation in the context of data privacy regulation. However, I am not an expert in the firm behaviour field, and I think someone with prior knowledge of work on theories of innovation might be better placed to comment. That said, I did see in a tweet that apparently this paper was discussed in the UK/EU Parliament to tout the benefits of GDPR in 2022. If so, that means the paper has quite a bit of influence already and likely has a more recent version as well.","Other: Economics/welfare, growth, policy, global markets and population",Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,deprioritized -- low ratings,Tradeoffs between privacy and economic performance seems like an important consideration.,Anirudh Tagat,Gavin Taylor,,,prominent,,,,,Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,70%,65%,68%,Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,,Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,,"Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance,Privacy Regulation and Firm Performance",,
