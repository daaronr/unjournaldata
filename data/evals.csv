A range of interventions aimed at influencing individual behavior have been considered, but there is very limited evidence on whether these are successful. Indeed, effective altruism linked animal welfare advocates have moved away from this approach in favor of corporate campaigns. 
However, this may be from a lack of evidence rather than evidence that these interventions are ineffective.  Of course, there may be heterogeneity; these may be more effective for some audiences than others. The extent to which these initiatives and ads are targeted towards seekers, neutral people, or even potential avoiders seems actionable and potentially consequential. E.g., we could compare ‘push’ vs ‘pull’ marketing, ads targeted towards those showing interest in animals versus more neutral or ‘surprise’ ads etc. 

The authors work seems to potentially have several rare and valuable aspects
 a credible strategy for differentiating the effects of such information/stimuli on avoiders versus seekers, in a way that seems robust to differential selection issues.  
incentivized choices (of food vouchers)
more consequential field evidence (linked to the lab experiment treatments?), with perhaps less potential for demand effects, temporary agreeability bias, etc.

In a general sense, The Unjournal is seeking to stimulate more rigorous social science research  relevant to animal welfare, including a focus on consumption attitudes.  This is one of our first forays in this direction.","Consistent with The Unjournal’s stated mission, and approach... We are  interested in the specific applied and empirical questions, and in the implications of this for animal welfare marketing interventions, and interventions in adjacent areas. We are somewhat less interested in the deep behavioral question of whether “individuals who prefer to avoid information are particularly responsive to it” (also noting that this latter relationship may itself be heterogeneous across groups and contexts) .
Consider the internal validity and external generalizability of this work. 
Are the causal claims plausible?  Do they do the WTP elicitation appropriately? 
Do they apply inverse probability weighting correctly to estimate the treatment effects?
In generalizing — Is this context reasonably representative of what future interventions are likely to involve?
To what extent are the results credibly suggest implications for longer-term diet changes (or attitudes towards animal welfare measures, perhaps)? 
How substantial are the incentives, and how well does the data capture important choices? 
How does the field data supplement the lab responses? Are there complimentary strengths and weaknesses of each?  Does the field data credibly address concerns about temporary effects, agreeableness bias, demand effects etc?
Is bias from selective attrition an issue?
Do the authors report the estimates that would be useful to animal welfare advocacy organizations? Are their other measures you would like to see reported?","Using Inverse Probability Weighting in causal inference/treatment effects

","Tabare Capitan noted “this paper is a good fit for me, in case you are looking for evaluators.. 
DR: Thanks Tabare. As of 12 Apr 2024 we are waiting for author permission. We’ll check in with them on about May 1 if they don’t get back to us earlier. ",,"Nicolas Treich  left a range of comments in an email, on an earlier version:

Here are some preliminary comments. Please note that these are immediate (not very thoughtful) reactions. I wrote everything as this came to my mind when reading the introduction, thinking this may be useful. Please note also that I only read the introduction. Hence, several comments might be irrelevant because addressed elsewhere in the paper.
 
1 Overall, the introduction looks good. It is a bit long though. Also, I understand that it may be a bit complex to write because there exists already quite a number of papers on strategic ignorance and also on the impact of information in the food domain. Therefore, it may be a bit difficult to identify the unique contribution of your paper, and different angles seem possible to present your paper. My main recommendation however would be to try to sharpen even more the message(s) in terms of the contribution with respect to the literature (both empirical and theoretical), and explain more in details why this is interesting and novel.

2 For instance, you stress that a “key question is whether deliberate ignorance is consequential for decision making”. If addressing this question is a key contribution of your paper, you should perhaps emphasize that this question has largely been ignored in the literature. Is this true?
 
3 For a theorist (like me), this might seem obvious that deliberate ignorance is “consequential” (in the sense of having consequences for decisions). Indeed, in all existing (whether behavioral or not) econ models, beliefs and information are expected to affect decisions. Could you justify a bit more why you think exploring this question is interesting? In particular, what makes you think that deliberate ignorance might be inconsequential? And further: what makes you think that your design based on having some information avoiders watching the video is particularly suited to study that question? It would be nice if you can explain more clearly why your design is “ideal” to test your specific research question.
 
4 Btw, I did not know that expression “deliberate ignorance”. I have seen on GoogleScholar that it is used with some frequency in the psychology literature. By this expression, I guess you want to emphasize here that people consciously decide to ignore information. I suppose this is in contrast to other situations where people might not be completely conscious that they ignore information, right? If you think this is an important aspect of your contribution, perhaps you should elaborate more on this, namely discuss “deliberate ignorance” as opposed to what type of ignorance.
 
5 Note that “receiving information” may not always equate to processing it. Playing devil’s advocate here, viewers of a video might devise strategies to avoid engagement. They might look away or close their eyes, lacking motivation to pay attention, or concoct stories such as deeming the content unrealistic or not representative. While I am sure you have considered these factors, they have crossed my mind, so I am sharing in case they are not discussed in the paper.
 
6 Given my background, what is missing in the introduction is a more explicit discussion about the link to the econ theory literature on strategic ignorance (and the motivated beliefs literature etc.).
 
7 It may also be nice to justify why you chose this context (animal farming) since the framing of your paper is much more general. Also, a quick discussion about the external validity about this aspect (ie, extensions to other contexts) may be useful in the introduction or elsewhere.
 
8 I notice that you do not talk about emotions (although you use the word “affective” at some point). Watching a video about intensive farming may generate emotions. In the paper, you talk about information. The link between emotions and information is not obvious. Note that we currently have a paper about the role of under videos about intensive farming and emotions. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4778679
 
9 The fact that you look at the (short and long term) impact on meat consumption is great. This is related to this paper:
“Eating to Save the Planet: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial Using Individual-Level Food Purchase Data” with Andrew Jalil and Arturo Vargas-Bustamante. Food Policy, Volume 95, August 2020, 101950
Combining lab and field experiment is also great.
 
10 Using a 360 degrees video sounds great and innovative. Should you emphasize more the advantages of this tool? But of course this also raises the issue of how specific is such an intervention. This original feature of your design sounds downplayed in the abstract/introduction. You mostly talk about information. I imagine you have thought about this a lot.
 
11 I did not get something basic: How do you lead some information avoiders to watch the video? I guessed this is due to the randomness of elicitation mechanism. Doesn’t that raise some specific econometric issues? Perhaps explain? Again, sorry for any misunderstanding. Moreover, I am not sure I understand why you show as a control a video that “all subjects have already watched at an earlier stage of the experiment”. I am not sure I understand why the video was already watched.
 
12 Your results are stimulating.
 
13 Explain in one or two sentences the Zimmerman’s conjecture that information interventions have no long term effects?
 
14 The observation that information avoiders are notably responsive to information a priori aligns with my expectation from a theorist. My initial interpretation is indeed that information avoiders may have been highly motivated to disregard information in the past, resulting in more distorted beliefs about intensive farming in general. Upon learning the truth, they subsequently update their beliefs more significantly, leading to relatively more pronounced changes in behavior than others. However, I noticed that information avoiders and information seekers seem to share similar beliefs and update similarly. You rightly emphasize the seemingly paradoxical result here. But I am confused then. How to explain this result? The paragraph where you discuss this (top of page 4) was a bit difficult to follow in a first quick reading.
 
15 Do you have info about past meat consumption? And whether there is a correlation between being a heavy meat eater and being information avoider? Our model of the meat paradox predicts a positive correlation.

Prefers NOT to be paid. Supports our general initiative.

PCI RR is a system that doesn’t require ‘publication in PCI’. All the projects he has worked on were psychology. 

Thinks we should try to enable more review before data has been collected. 
We could review the PAP’s. ... 
They invite a lot of  people.
He reads in detail. They use discretion.
Referees disappear between the stages.
People who accept, mostly psychologists, more concerned with openness and less hierarchy.  Intrinsic motivation. 
PCI-RR in principle acceptance and later acceptance. 
Economists are obsessed with rankings and excellence, culture at PCI is a bit different. Whether a paper is good enough for scientific standards. 
Paolo Crosetto, ‘peer review to check whether it’s sound’, people check whether it’s useful. 
In economics we focus on topic that are important for society but where you demonstrate technique etc. We stray from the less clean areas where you can say less.

Similar comments as to the one below.

This evaluator has specific expertise on the method, having published in top 5 an RDD paper. He should be more familiar with the expectations in top 5 journals. He also stated having issues pointing towards any major flaws. 
DR: (Tabare Capitan ) Are we sure he was the “econometrician” on that paper? I wasn’t sure how to interpret his “having issues” comment. Do you think that meant he thought all of the choices were made optimally? But then, why not say that? Even if that is the would be good to have him weigh in a bit on ‘what choices were made and why they were justified, and what alternate choices could have been made, and why these would have been less valid’
That said, he also said he was unsure about what he was expected to do beyond a regular report. I can ask them both to add a section on “Should we believe the main claim?” Which makes me think that there may be a benefit in including a more structured report to fill, starting with that one first question. If we do this, perhaps we should explicitly tell people to address internal and external validity. Then we can leave room for flexibility.

@Emmanuel Orkoh I’m supportive of this. I don’t think the specific context (S.

This paper studies the long-term effects of the 1963 US measles vaccine, and is relevant for funding vaccines in developing countries. Previous research on this question uses reported measles cases as a proxy for disease burden. This paper improves on the literature by explicitly accounting for reporting rates. It uses two models: (1) a reduced-form ‘disease burden’ approach, regressing long-term economic outcomes on pre-vaccine measles mortality (cross-sectional) interacted with vaccine exposure (time series); (2) an epidemiological SIR model, designed to capture geographic variation in actual cases immediately before the vaccine. It finds positive effects for the reduced-form model, consistent with previous papers, but not for the epidemiological model. 
","The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the reduced-form approach. From the abstract: “Our results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic literature.”
The reduced-form approach in the literature  in the literature uses reported incidence.  Chuard (2022) uses mortality in their reduced-form model, while other papers use reported incidence. Pre-vaccine mortality could arguably be a proxy for this.  But the authors don’t seem to consider whether pre-vaccine mortality correlates with reported incidence. Does this matter? 
They authors claim that reported incidence is a proxy for disease burden. Is this justified? Could they test this empirically?
How does the concept of  ‘disease burden’ apply to a universal disease like measles (with nearly 100% infection rates). In light of this, what is the identifying variation?
Do the authors clearly state their identifying assumptions? Is their identification justified? 
They do not present an event study to test for pre-trends — is this an important limitation?

Going through I4rep, I just came across this: Replication of Atwood's (2022) ""The Long-Term Effects of Measles Vaccination on Earnings and Employment"". Were you aware of it? Do you think we should reach out to one of these replicators, if we want a third?
","The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the reduced-form approach.   From the abstract: “Our results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic literature.” Michael Wiebe is this the part you were referring to? How does this ‘support the reduced form approach?’  
MW: yes, and they also have a discussion at the end of the paper. The support for the reduced-form approach is because they get the same results, which is taken as evidence in favor.
What I’m initially confused by is that the question of ‘which methodology is better’ should not be informed by ‘what the findings are’ (unless we had a gold standard to compare to). But that’s probably not what they are saying and I should look closer. 
MW: Exactly. The way they’ve framed this, they stand or fall with the Atwood (2022) results. They’ve found consistent results, but it’s possible that the method is flawed (plausible because, for measles, there’s no long-run geographic variation in incidence). In that case, both papers are wrong. (And it could be that the SIR model is right, and measles vaccination has no effect; but I have issues with those results too.)

However, it's possible that your remarks would give away who you are as people can see you're on our team if they look. Your call.
Michael Wiebe  fwiw I’m adding some ‘sidebar comments’ in pubpub on the evaluations. These could potentially be put together into an “evaluation manager’s note”. Note we are also interested in doing more to communicate our output to more general audiences (e.g., on the EA Forum, or maybe even in Asterisk magazine or Vox etc). Perhaps this could also be repurposed there? I put some sidebar comments in the PubPub that could be incorporated into such a writeup.
Let me know if you can see those comments. Also pasted below JIC.

Positives: 
Aiming towards actionable results in a space where this is very challenging. 
Willing to consider actual plausible numbers/ranges for growth rate and X-risk (etc.) impacts in considering this. 
Seems largely well-written and well thought out. Seems to give intuition for his insights.

Concerns/limitations: 
In spite of the valiant attempts, is this really a space where the theory/modeling results will influence actions/choices/policy levers, or broad thinking and funding choices of people in the AI safety spave? 
Will there ever be a consensus on things like ‘the range of reasonable curvature of social utility functions?
Is this a sort of ‘interim discussion paper’ ... is another more comprehensive paper coming out that will make this obsolete? 
Strategic concern for UJ: ‘it’s another C Jones paper’ ... doesn’t expand our exposure

Valentin Klotzbücher let’s have our conversation about choice of evaluators here
VK wrote: 
From the evaluator pool I think these two might be suitable:
Michael Chaitkin https://chaitkin.com/publications/ 
Justin (Loiseau) Labeille https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinloiseaulabeille/
DR: I think generally appropriate but I’m not sure if they have specific interests in the methods or this type of intervention. IIRC Justin is more policy and less research academic?
VK: I agree, both not a perfect fit

VK: 
Alternatively maybe one of the authors of this study (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102747) citing the WP?
 https://girijabahety.com/
 https://dev-patel.com/
 https://scholar.harvard.edu/bauhoff/home
DR: Yes, I think these could be ideal. Maybe write one of them or more of them and ask them to suggest which of the co-authors might be most interested and suitable for doing this?
VK: All right, I will write maybe first to one of them and send also the invite  

VK:
What do you think about these two:
https://mcknaus.github.io/
https://www.anthonystrittmatter.com/publications
DR: Both seem ideal in terms of the methods. I guess it’s low probability that they will do it, but if one of them are willing to do so, I think it’s worth it. 
VK: I know Tony relatively well and I think he might do it, but I am also not sure, will try
Two evaluations or 3?
DR: I suggest we do this opportunistically. In addition to Dillon, let’s try to get one of the “Text don’t nudge” co-authors, and then either Mcknaus or Strittmatter. But if neither of the latter will do it, we can stick with just 2. Make sense?
VK: Makes sense. Invited now Girija Bahety, am discussing with Tony Strittmatter he says he is very busy but in general interested - maybe I can offer him also to do it until end of May? 
Valentin Klotzbücher I see a second email to Girija saved in the PubPub but not sent. You did send one. Can we delete the second one?
VK: Yes please, that was another email address but I decided to sent it to the private one - somehow the system doesn’t let me delete it (once I save/refresh it is there again). 
Discussion with Tony was not successful, he’s too busy but said he is potentially interested in evaluating other papers in the future. I told him he could join the evaluator pool. 
Starting now to look for alternatives for Girija as we haven’t heard from her. 

DR, Valentin Klotzbücher  — note there are some people above we considered but still haven’t asked
VK: Iinvited now M Knaus, and te other autors D Patel, J Potter and S Bauhoff.
Okay so M. Knaus declined and the others are not reacting so far. I guess we have to look further, priority on someone with a development/behavioral econ background. 
david reinstein: Dev Patel accepted now and I think he is a great fit. Should I write to him again and offer to talk? And I guess I should remove the other invited candidates from PubPub?!
→ Submitted evaluation but it was minimal and inadequate. 

Removed from PubPub the following invited, non-responding candidates (the 3 co-authors of Dev Patel):
James Potter 
Sebastian Bauhoff
Girija Bahety


VK:
Other potential evaluators: 
authors of Nudging toward vaccination: a systematic review
DR: seems to be targetting the same question with a different approach; seems promising
and/or https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01813-4 ?
DR: Also seems highly relevant to the context, and they should have a good perspective on the literature
DR: but for both of these papers, 
so many authors so it's hard to know which one has the right expertise
Is there expertise in developing country context?
Will they be familiar at all with the statistical approaches used and with the ~econometrics involved? Not sure there are economists here
I know Hengchen Dai from a different project I was involved in and if I recall, she was pretty good. Maybe she would be good to ask and feel free to mention my name? Perhaps it would be better to just ask her in an email and let her make the decision whether she has the relevant expertise to engage in detail with some of the questions here?
VK: completely agree, not sure who of the authors to ask and whether they have sufficient background knowledge for this case. Asking Hengchen Dai first sounds like a good strategy → wrote to her, she is busy but potentially available in the future.

","Valentin Klotzbücher we can discuss some ‘overriding” things in this box. 

DR: One concern — last update April 2021, for such a big project. I’m surprised there is nothing newer. As well as contacting the authors soon, we should do some snooping around. 
DR: My pet peeve — LASSO is not meant as a technique for ‘selecting coefficients’

“The most cost-effective policy (information hubs, SMS reminders, no incentives) increases the number of immunizations per dollar by 9.1%” —- this is not a value/cost measure because it depends on the immunization base rate etc. Encourage them to estimate and report even more relevant Benefit/Cost measures 
",,,,,9,51 days,,"Eval 1 — begins with “This is an absolutely superb paper”
DR: 
Over the top praise without enough substance or comparison.
Signs of uncareful/uncalibrated ratings ... all at the top, narrow or degenerate CIs esp ranking part — maxes out.
Almost no content in evaluation report.
Not up to our minimum standards. If they responds with a bit more content we can pay them, but we may not want to post this. 
","
","DR: I’m also somewhat interested  in seeing if their approach is deemed methodologically appropriate by experts in adaptive design, “First, we use a LASSO technique to collapse the data: we pool dosages of the same treatment if the data cannot reject that they had the same impact, and prune policies deemed ineffective.”  (Max Kasy, perhaps).  Not sure  what this has to do with LASSO; I guess they meant something else in the abstract. Also ‘cannot reject’ can simply be a lack of power; is this approach theoretically grounded?
Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winner’s curse. — interesting, evaluator should consider if their correction is the right one. 
Incentives vs reminders etc... this would seem to inform charities like “New Incentives”

They should ask ct. I actually just met him for the first time at Chicago last week.

I very much agree with her comments regarding the use of causal language, search and screening processes for SRs, and expected reporting requirements. There are pretty firm standards in the field for these.
Also, I find it interesting to see the difference between her comments / tone and her actual assessments. While the comments come off as quite critical, the scores are actually quite positive. 
I was a bit surprised that she said she is not an expert in the area as she has published on the effects of other toxins (largely tobacco and cannabis) on child development. So, related, but I guess not exactly in her field. 

DR: I was not so happy with the evaluation. It more or less meets our minimum standards, but it didn’t really seem to dig into the technical issues or the specifics of the paper.  It felt a bit boilerplate, simply going down the list and saying things like ‘this is missing citations’ and ‘this is missing a PRISMA flowchart’. Generally fair points, but not engaging the evaluator’s expertise, not addressing issues with the more technical and detailed analyses: meta-regression, publication bias corrections, heterogeneity, IV vs OLS comparisons, etc. Also not engaging the evaluator’s expertise on child development. I’d say it’s about at the 15-20th percentile for our evaluations.  
Update DR — I think I was a bit too harsh, maybe 30-35th percentile.

IIRC the seasonal labour migration is generally accepted to not scale very well, so Givewell might not find much value in extra evaluation.
DR: @Gavin Taylor it still might be worth exploring further: 1. as a general issue, 2. because the NLS ‘failure’ (as stated by Givewell: https://blog.givewell.org/2019/06/06/evidence-action-is-shutting-down-no-lean-season/#2017Study)  seemed to be largely about management issues and evidence that it didn’t actually lead to net emigration … but effects of emigration (if it indeed could be influenced) could still be  helpful to know  3. to understand ‘why it failed’ if so.  We don’t want to ‘overlearn’ or learn the wrong lessons.

The authors here (quick look) seem to claim the transportation subsidies they offered had an impact on migration. Could be useful to better understand the discrepancy, if there is one.
That said, I’m thinking this paper is probably not up-to-date so maybe. worth waiting to see if something else comes out
@david reinstein yeah, I didn’t check if the authors had any newer publications on the intervention. The senior author (Mobarak) does have other publications on migration (some in NBER), could be worth reaching out to see if he would be interested in having work evaluated and could suggest the most relevant
https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KRXr5_oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate

These also often relevant to important/impactful global health interventions (see e.g., this Guardian article), as well as  measures to control the spread of pandemics.   (But we have some disagreement about how impactful the nudge parts of the interventions are.]
We also had some doubts about the particular concerns about nudges expressed in this paper in terms of their importance in a global impact sense. 
At least at a skim, the paper assumes/considers a case where the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies. Thus the impact of nudges 'in equilibrium with the government response' has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the 'best compromise'.  This approach to the question is fairly standard from a public economics pov. 
The issue still seems a bit less than first-order.

But arguments about this may still be influential. We perceive some important pushbacks against the ‘nudge agenda’, and this may be a fairly central issue.  The authors are prominent and there is some chance that the paper itself will influence policy, perhaps entering into the considerations of ‘nudge units’ or the arguments made against particular interventions. 
“It is quite a substantive paper and I think an evaluation could get into both the theory and details of the experiments”
","Some issues that came to me (David R.) after a skim of the paper:
Is a model in which government adjusts taxes/subsidies optimally a relevant one for this discussion? Do their arguments meaningfully carry over to a more general environment?
“Welfare also depends on whether the NPI reduces the variance of distortions from heterogenous biases and externalities, and the average effect becomes irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes.”
Is this main argument correct, are there flaws in it, is it robust to relevant small modifications in the theoretical model?
“We apply our framework to randomized experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels ...” These experiments were run on a particular pool of participants, asking questions about particular contexts. 
Are the inferences made from these participants in this context meaningful? Does the experiment itself add any ‘value of information’? I.e., do we know more about something important in the real world, adjusting or concentrating our beliefs, after having seen the results of the experiment 
(If so) do the results in this context meaningfully generalize in ways that will help inform (globally) important real-world policies?  
There were some real incentives to choose according to one’s true preferences (in the drinks case?) or to get state WTP ‘correctly’ as imputed from their earlier survey responses (in the autos case).   
Were these incentives strong, meaningful, and correctly aligned?
... Usual considerations about statistical modeling of the results, statistical inferences, structure of any structural (?) model used to derive welfare implications; consistency with pre-registration/pre-analysis plan

","David R – I’d particularly value evaluators with:
an applied understanding of public finance/public econ. theory, considering normative issues
experience considering the value of framed choice experiments and elicitations like this, and how generalizable they are to real world markets of interest. ",,,"Florian Habermacher  — moving your notes here to organize the discussion 
 ... first yield after going through the Evaluator Pool - you might find a hint of my preference for generalist econ thinkers as opposed to subfield specialists. Happy to be overridden:
Max R. P. Grossmann - stumbled upon him in the list when searching 'equilibrium' and had a good feeling, as general good economist
Gulbike Mirzaoglu - applied econ & quant with some behavioral/risk aspects; also seems good impression.
Neither of these are specifically behavioral economics experimenters. But I'm actually at least slightly less worried about the experiments per se in the paper, and more interested in the relevance/applicability of the observations in general (I see there the largest issue I have with the paper so far).
Still, if you find a more typical behav econ gamer would be preferable - or for any other suggestions -... 
DR: Florian Habermacher
Max seems like a strong fit for several reasons: Experimental economics, research on  ‘choice architecture‘ , let’s ask him.
I’m not convinced Gulbike has the right skills and interest for this one. 

I’d particularly value evaluators with
an applied understanding of public finance/public econ. theory, considering normative issues
experience considering the value of framed choice experiments and elicitations like this, and how generalizable they are to real world markets of interest. 
Actually not sure if the paper is really ‘behavioral’ per se; at least it’s not considering any particular psychological ‘biases’.
I also thought of Bob Sugden, as he’s spoken and written a bit skeptically of “the Nudge agenda”. I believe he has the public econ understanding in spades. Maybe not so much the choice/experiment relevance and generalizability thing. But getting his input would also be great for The Unjournal. I think David Hugh-Jones has some contact with him as well, he could put in a good word perhaps.
Florian: Agree with everything that has been written here (esp. that the eval action will be less in ‘behavioral’ subtleties per se); would highly appreciate Bob Sugden (didn’t know him but after quick googling..).
david reinstein Should I ask Max now? (Scholar GPT finds no conflicts, i.e. no co-autorships)
By the way   I sketched an outreach to Bob Sugden here, but it may make more sense for David Hugh-Jones to contact him first, as David HJ is closer to Bob than I am.
David Hugh-Jones will you contact to Bub Sugden?
By the way Bob said no

david reinstein I’ve contacted Max Grossmann (pubpub & separate personal email); received an autoreply: ooo until 23 Mar. [Asked, agreed]
Florian Habermacher some possible evaluators: [Asked]
Luigi Butera - Research — Cited as the author of  a paper that  ‘quantitatively evaluate[s] the welfare effects of NPIs’. I know him. Reached out to him on LinkedIn and he seems interested.  [Update —  there is a COI] 
Tatiana Homonoff | NYU Wagner — Does research and teaches public economics and behavioral economics.  I suspect she is rigorous. [Asked]
Mike Sanders — he’s a professor in London, was big in the UK Nudge Unit. He’s very much on the policy side, less on the theory or quantification side.  I know him well. [Asked]
Glenn Harrison — unlikely to do this himself, but it’s right in his area and he should have some great suggestions [Asked]

",,,,,,5,44 days,,"DR ~60th percentile. 

Seems to misunderstand the theoretical framework a bit:
Implicit in this paper’s consideration is that government interventions rarely care about average effects on the population, but on particular groups. In this sense, the effort to consider non-mean effects on welfare is welcome.
I don’t think the theory or the experiments are so concerned with ‘heterogeneity by real world groups’ for it’s own sake (but maybe I’m wrong).

His discussion of the limitation of the incentives seems correct to me.
I’m not sure whether the discussion of multiple comparisons in measuring heterogeneity is right here — Florian Habermacher What do you think?. 

Florian Habermacher we should also ‘evaluate the evaluations’ here. ","DR ~60th percentile.

Florian Habermacher we should also ‘evaluate the evaluations’ here. ","DR: I partially disagree with Ryan in that I think that these nudges may have rather large effects on key health and environment behaviors, or at least policymakers may think they do and improving the PMs’  beliefs may have a lot of of value. However, the lab-like nature of the evidence may limit its influence and impact (even though the authors are fairly prominent). The theoretical part of their work might have more influence, but I’m not sure.
OK reading a bit more,~~ the ‘second order effects of nudge on equilibrium prices distorting choices’~~ aspect, seems like it might be fairly unimportant in a global impact sense. Correction – their model assumes (?) the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies, and thus the impact of nudges ‘in equilibrium with the government response’ has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the ‘best compromise’.  This still seems a bit less than first-order, but perhaps somewhat more consequential.
[And also/on the other hand] if the ‘paper itself will influence policy’ (which I’m not convinced about) it could be impactful for us to have this evaluated, and beneficial for us to engage.

@Tanya O’Garra The paper’s title seems to have been changed to “The Environmental Effects of Economic Production: Evidence from Ecological Observations” – let’s make sure the evaluators consider the most recent version

Nakamura or Steinsson or a critic of this approach?
> We exploit variation in local economic production driven by U.S. military buildups, which are heavily influenced by geopolitical factors and unexpected military events. This research strategy has been widely used in the empirical macroeconomics literature to estimate the causal effect of government spending on total economic output, i.e., the fiscal multiplier (Hall, 2009; Barro and Redlick, 2011; Ramey, 2011; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018).
Deryugina, Garth Heutel, Nolan H Miller, David Molitor, or Julian Reif
> We use a research design that isolates variation in local pollution driven by transported pollution from distant, upwind cities (e.g., Deryugina et al., 2019; Anderson, 2020).

Anirudh Tagat — you are managing this one, right? Have you made any progress identifying evaluators, emailing them, etc?  I don’t see anything in the system. Let me know if I can help... making some suggestions, sending some emails etc.
AT: Sorry for the delay, I was hoping that a few people outside the pool could come in for this. But I have had limited success, so I have invited 3 folks from the pool and will rescind the last invite if all three accept.

DR suggestions, first from our pool/applicants
Lee Crawfurd — in our evaluation pool (applied, adding soon) seems very  =relevant  → accepted
Maybe:
Masyhur Hilmy  → declined?
  Willa → declined

Outside the pool
Karthik Muralidharan, if he is willing to put time into this.

~All content shared in “Bespoke evaluation notes”
","Karger suggestions
‘Is this generally important?’ 
Is the data/release of the data useful?  [where can we find this]
Did they explain it well?
 
Digging into the subresults:  A handful of experts in any topic. Very few in some areas. AI has a few more.  They have specific subsections for each topic area. 
We could ask experts ‘are they correctly describing the debates in this space?’ Did they ask the right questions? Are these really people with the right expertise?
We don’t need to do our usual ‘pay two evaluators’ 

FRI ‘next steps’ post
FRI  made an EA Forum post seeking input on the next steps, for their next version. Some of these suggest things to evaluate, especially... 
1. Deliberation/consensus-building process: They expected “deliberation and argument would lead forecasters to update on one another’s beliefs and arguments and eventually converge on similar probabilities.” But this did not occur on questions where they disagreed most.
Were their expectations wrong here? Does previous work suggest this convergence would not happen? 
Were their methods of facilitating deliberation insufficient? Are there better approaches they should use?
[AH] Was the entire protocol designed such that shifting was a natural thing to do?
2. Methods of eliciting low-probability forecasts: ~ ’People are bad and inconsistent at giving probability forecasts for rare events’. This may apply to area experts and superforecasters too.  
How should we expect this to have biased or frustrated their approach?
What are some better methods for eliciting these rare event forecasts, training people to be better at them, and measuring reliability of forecasters (for weighting the forecasts) in this domain? 
[AH: there is a literature on earthquake elicitation etc. — Annemarie Christophersen from GNS science, NZ would know loads about that]

Unjournal suggestions for issues to evaluate
'Reciprocal scoring':  Is the 'reciprocal scoring' rule likely to motivate honest (incentive-compatible) predictions? Is it likely to generate useful information in this context?
For all this to generate value, they seem to rely a lot on being able to compare reciprocal accuracy to real-world accuracy starting in 2024. [AH is there enough evidence to suggest reciprocal accuracy is a good predictor of real accuracy? ]This suggests that if these does correlate (in certain ways), they will then look to the remaining ‘reciprocal data’ to make predictions about the real world for events further in the future. But is this reasonable? Did their study really produce data that will enable them to powerfully consider this and reliably make inferences?
[AH] there are a couple of results showing that how people present themselves is very (positively) correlated with how they are perceived and scored by their peers,  but there’s no correlation between that ranking and the performance in terms of accuracy, calibration or informativeness.

more accurate reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk 

But is this meaningful, or is it just simply that the unusual people who thought there is high X-risk thought others are likely to think the same? Is it more finely grained 'better reciprocal accuracy' than that?
Also, this correlation seems to hold visually, but I don't see metrics or statistical inference here. 
Is there a lack of statistical power?

Recruitment etc.:
Was the choice of ‘experts’ reasonable?  Were the other groups recruited in ways that would tilt them towards one side or the other, or towards being intransigent? Were there ‘cultural things’ going on; do Superforecasters have particular characteristics or biases that might make them especially optimistic about x-risk, or to be hostile to the arguments of effective altruists and x-risk doomsayers? And vice/versa?
Were there implementation issues in the recruitment of superforecasters, as this thread suggests?
[AH] were superforecasters identified as such, for them and for other groups?
Should we be concerned about a potential bias due to the substantial attrition?

Prediction question choice and framing: 
Were the prediction questions relevant? 
Were they well-framed?
They seem to have displayed these along with particular “Prior Forecasts” — is that appropriate? Could that be driving the persistent difference between the superforecasters and experts?
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] Framing of ‘questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks’ — 
I suspect there is a prior literature on ‘eliciting policy choices’ from the public and policymaker participants. Did they set this up well?

Other survey/experimental methods issues
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact...]  “Public survey of 912 college graduates” — 
This ‘general population survey’ is obviously a well-studied method. Did they do this well (recruiting methods, survey elicitation instrument, etc.)?

Statistical analysis and reporting: 
Is the focus on the median forecast and the bootstrapped confidence interval the right choice here (their argument for this is rather informal)? 
What about the other aggregation methods they use? Which seems most useful, or is another approach warranted? True ‘the large gaps between expert and superforecaster beliefs are robust across aggregation methods’, and it appears so in the tables they show. However, it would be helpful to get some expert consideration of this for future work. It is not easy to know if all of the possible results presented are robust to all reasonable aggregation methods.
 Other studies let the aggregation methods compete.  Tetlock’s group often advocates for the extremizing one, which seemed to perform best for near-term followup event.
(See above on “reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk.”)
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] “Assessments of risk were highly correlated” — they present some ad-hoc statistics here, but they don’t really model this. If this correlation indeed holds, is this useful, or is it meant to reflect something else that helps us interpret the results? In either case, is their a better way to statistically model and test this? 

Presentation and communication: 
Visuals and summary statistics: Are there more useful and informative ways of presenting the (differences in) the forecasts? 
Can you recommend some easy ways to add value here? Given the data shared, would it easy to convert this into a hosted ‘dashboard’ style?

Overriding issues
What exactly was the goal of this project and this analysis? To generate the highest quality forecasts? If so, what is the case for their particular approach.
Did they preregister?

Other methodology things (integrate above)
Why is the protocol the way it is? Why the separate groups and then the mixed groups?
Did you ask them about uncertainty, why not?
Was the discussion synchronous and is there any analysis about synchronous  vs. asynchronous conditioning for convergence results.

Parts of the paper to skip or skim
Although the paper appears very long, much of it could be skipped or skimmed. A lot is background for lay people that our evaluators are likely to already know. Much also  involves detailed descriptive presentation of the results. The appendix largely involves repeated tables of results/data and the complete survey instrument. We mainly want the evaluators to focus on the methodology of the study design, the approach to presenting the results, the statistical analysis (or lack thereof), and the high level inferences and implications drawn from the evidence collected. The evaluators could also weigh in on the particular x-risk areas that they may have expertise in, considering whether these were presented meaningfully.
“Background & motivation” ... (for a lay audience)
“Comparing experts to superforecasters” (for a lay audience)
Results — a lot of space in the main text is devoted to graphing and tabling these differences, along with the same notes each time. This can go quickly.
“How the XPT results compare to prior risk estimates” — this  section is less in need of methodological expert evaluation (although experts on these particular risk areas might be consulted to check if the sources are reputable and authoritative)
“Contrasting experts and superforecasters in different domains” largely recaps what we saw/heard before, with some layman’s explanation
Questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks — interesting but may not benefit from expert evaluation (but see question above)
“Relationships between risk predictions in different domains” — this seems to involve some ad-hoc descriptive statistics ... not sure how useful these are to pore over, if there are no real implications here.
“How time spent thinking about existential risk relates to forecasts of those risks” (obvious/boring IMO)
“Individual risk areas” — each evaluator could read/skim through two of these. (Evaluators with particular expertise on these risk areas should also comment on the appropriateness of the discussion and framing).",,,,"AH: You want people who were/are part of the expert elicitation community.

My conversation with Ezra Karger, notes

I’m taking some notes in hypothes.is (here)",,,,,7,52 days,,"DR: 30% 50% (about at the median of our evaluations)  I see substance and high-level suggestions here. I’d like to see the evaluator go into a bit more detail, with specific suggestions and critiques though. Particularly in their area of expertise, involving persuasion. 
Looking at it again, it does seem a bit less than we would expect, so maybe at the 30th percentile.  And yes, she got similar emails.

Anca Hanea What do you think? 
NB, a quick link to the evaluation is here. It’s a pdf and we prefer the raw files, so we need to reach out to the evaluator for this anyway.  Anca, would you want to write to them to ask for a little bit of followup? They indicated a willingness to evaluate a revised version, so they have some willingness to followup (although we are a bit vague about compensation on this). ",,"DR: Note it’s a 751 page pdf (only about 75 pages up to the bibliography, about 22k words); perhaps they have a better web interface; we would need to consider how to have it evaluated.
DR: I’m going to consider it in our ‘nonacademic stream’ perhaps; it’s going to target academia at some point, but I don’t think the current version could be assessed in that way
GT: I voted no because I thought that 750 pages was too big for us to meaningfully evaluate with our current procedure. But looking back, I see that the main body of the report is only goes to page 75, and about 500 pages is appendix 7. So as long as we don’t expect anybody to go through the appendices in detail it seems ambitious but possible for an evaluator.
For these long reports (also Matt’s Returns to Science one) I think we might want to give evaluators some specific guidelines about what to cover, rather than just going through everything as they might for a peer review(I’m not sure sure how academic book publishers do peer review any differently from journal publishers, but I assume their mandate is usually to cover everything)
DR: I agree Gavin. I propose
We have it evaluated as a non-academic-stream output.
We carefully limit which aspects/sections we ask evaluators to consider
I think scoping this out and evaluating managing this will be considerable work. So I’m thinking that I’ll both look for an evaluation manager (maybe paying a little extra) and help them by doing a lot of this work myself.

Incorporating from comments
I spoke with Ezra, he is cooperative

DR: Reading the paper
From what I’m seeing, there’s a real lack of formal technical content. Even though the paper is very long in pages, its a lot of repetition, simple background for a lay audience, and repeated presentations of tables of results and question instruments (~putting all the data into a pdf :)).
I think we should be able to identify a limited set of issues the evaluators could focus on.
[I did this]
AH:
agreed...for now, i added some notes and some links to evaluators from the expert judgement community

Samara: This is a topic I think about a lot but don’t necessarily work on, so I don’t know how relevant the paper is for my work (or others). However, there are a few things in the paper that would be interesting to evaluate further.
In terms of the topic, I think there’s a wide interest in concentration in the meat industry. But I have some open questions that may imply the topic isn’t very relevant to people’s work:
To what degree can animal advocates/EAs affect the concentration of the animal agriculture industry?
To what degree is concentration more harmful than diffusion for non-human animals? I’ve been wondering this for a long time, and I’m not totally sure (and there’s only a little research on it). It seems to be mostly bad for humans, so I suspect on net it’s more harmful, but maybe I’m wrong or at least wrong in the case of animal welfare. I guess this is an argument for more research into the overall effects of concentration-reducing policies, but that’s not really the point of this paper.
If you think the topic is relevant, I think there are some details worth examining in the paper.
Did the authors conduct any sensitivity analysis on the demand elasticity parameter (they don’t report it), and if so what were the results?  There are a few reasons that I could believe that their choice of demand elasticity was hasty, but it may not change their conclusions much.
This might be outside the scope of the evaluation process, but I’m curious what might the theoretical model look like with a different definition of resilience? Specifically, one that included some measure of animal welfare and non-consumer human welfare as they’re affected by these exogenous events and subsequent closures (like the mass livestock cullings that happened in early 2020 as a result of plant closures, or plant worker stress associated with having to work extra hours during the pandemic in plants that didn’t close). This might all fall under the welfare analysis section (i.e., including animals in the social welfare function, or adding cost of worker injury/illness, etc) or it might need a overhaul of the theory model. I didn’t look to hard at that model.
Looking more closely at all of the (many) assumptions throughout the paper could be warranted.
My question about concentration/market power and animal welfare generally revolves around the factors you mentioned: political influence, stocking density, worker training, access to health care, etc. There’s some work on it, but I don’t have strong sense of the net harm to animals from concentration.
It seems the demand elasticity point is the most tractable for review, and also probably the easiest to just email the authors lol … instead of conducting a full evaluation.",Markets for products with large externalities (focus: animal agriculture),Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,01_Needs prioritization/assessor rating,,,"animal welfare,economics",,,,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,55%,,60%,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,,"Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains",,,,,,,

I liked this article.
KG: I also liked this. I think it has interesting ramifications on long-run scientific progress, and I wonder if there’s a way of framing AI alignment in the early stages of this, which may have spillovers. I don’t think it’s a standard economics paper, and I think my confidence intervals on this paper are pretty wide but I’ve put a high percentage here despite this
GT: To be honest, despite all the attention, this got, it reads more like a policy paper than empirical research to me. There seem to be a lot of analogies used to describe their model of effort vs. impact, but the only data is in Fig. 7, to support their claim that novelty is weakly correlated with citations (I do like the fact they are measuring novelty with a textual analysis). I feel that most of the effort in an evaluation would be to check that their sources/analogies actually do support their model and then provides sufficient justification for their proposals - overall this seems like it will be quite subjective.
DR: Gave it a quick skim. Looked like anecdotes + very toy model + opinion + maybe a very quick empirical exercise (which could have been interesting if they had gone into more detail).
This does seem interesting for our own consideration of prioritization – do they give any formal measurable definition of ‘scientific impact’, though?
My impression is also that, even though these are ‘NBER authors’ this was not a fully-baked effort.","Innovation, meta-science, and research",Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,02_final consideration needed,,Gavin Taylor,,,,,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,,80%,60%,67%,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,,"Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives",2024-05-19T00:00:00.000-04:00,,,,,,

I [Rosie] am hugely grateful to the reviewers for their time and expertise, and agree with many (though not all) of their comments. For context, these guidelines are not a published paper, but are WIP internal guidelines that we use at FP to estimate internal and external validity rankings across different RCTs. I'm especially pleased that Unjournal chose to review it, as it is often difficult to get reviews of this style of work
I unfortunately can't engage more at present without dropping on really high-priority work, but I hope to respond more fully in the next few months; I am keen to find and test different methods of estimating effect size inflation and Type S error. I would view it as a hugely positive thing if the reviewers (or other readers) have uncovered superior ways of estimating these metrics—especially methods that are practical for time-pressured decision and policy-makers. I hope that this prompts more discussion in this area.

I checked with my coauthors and they were fine to go ahead.
 
We all realize that this might be good publicity for the idea, which is nice.
 
One coauthor, perhaps stating a downside that won’t surprise Unjournal founders, is that there is always the chance of negative comments, which is ok, that’s what academic debate is for. Perhaps the concern is that there is a slim chance that a negative comment rises to the level of requiring some response, sucking up time authors are short on. The hope is that that is unlikely , but is possible, and is outweighed by the benefits of coverage. In any event, that wasn’t a reason not to participate since we realize that authors don’t have veto power over how the paper is used!

>  Specifically, when a treated firm committed a violation, citizen volunteers who cooperated with our experiment filed an appeal through one of two broadly-defined channels: (1) private appeals where the citizens complained to the regulator or the firm about the violation in ways that could not be observed by other members of the public; (2) public appeals where the citizens complained about the violation on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform that is comparable to Twitter. In total, the experiment intervened against nearly 3,000 pollution violations.
> Specifically, we randomized the
visibility of social media appeals about a violation by experimentally adding 10 additional “likes” and “shares” to the Weibo post, which would otherwise obtain 0.66 “likes” and “shares” naturally.
> if anything, the interventions might have created positive spillover effects. For example, the relative probability of a violation was either unchanged or lower among the control and treatment firms in the higher intensity prefectures, although the reduced violation rates are not always statistically significant by conventional criteria
DR: I’d like to see a CI or posterior distribution over these effects and differences, considering the policy implications
DR: In deciding whether to evaluate:
1. Is there any actionable intervention here? Can China/outsiders/NGOs do anything to encourage or facilitate this sort of citizen participation? Would any ‘intervention’ in this case backfire if the government were aware of this?
2. Is this likely to extend to other governments and policies, and to the future in China, or is it very specific to this one situation (albeit a very important one)

 I think that it would be good to have 
(1) an expert in text analysis;
 (2) an expert in measuring company performance indicators; and 
(3) someone who has done something like this paper but for climate change/other ESG measures. 
He is also concerned to get perspectives on financial measures from mainstream econ/finance researchers from outside the “ESG impacts on financial returns” subfield/focal area 
In discussion with david reinstein it was decided to prioritise #1 and #2. We may later consider whether a referee fitting #3 would be useful",,,"Ben Balmford chatGPT made a few suggestions that seemed reasonable:
Jillian Grennan  adjunct assoc. professor,  research active, seems to do some actual corporate finance stuff, GPT claims “Grennan specializes in employing innovative computational techniques to quantify corporate culture, sustainability, and diversity, equity, and inclusion objectives, utilizing machine learning and natural language processing.”
Ivan Diaz-Rainey: An Associate Professor and the Director of the Climate and Energy Finance Group at the University of Otago. Diaz-Rainey's work on climate finance and the transition to a low-carbon economy involves applying econometric and financial analysis to understand market responses to climate policies. → invited → accepted
Elizabeth Demers “An Associate Professor of Accounting at the University of Virginia, Demers specializes in financial reporting and analysis, with a focus on how company disclosures affect investor perceptions and company performance. Her empirical research methods and expertise in analyzing financial statements and performance indicators would be highly relevant.” → accepted → later backed out. 

Dragan Ilic “An Assistant Professor at the University of Basel, Ilić's work in the intersection of finance and sustainability, with a focus on quantitative methods and empirical finance, could `provide insights into measuring company performance with respect to biodiversity risks.”
Stephanie F. Cheng “Assistant Professor of Accounting at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Her research interests include using textual analysis to understand corporate disclosures and investor responses.”
GPT also suggested Harrison Hong. A long shot, but if he’s a nice person, he might at least have some suggestions.

I also looked through our volunteer evaluators database, but nothing sprang up. I couldn’t find a lot of expertise on the corporate finance/asset pricing/event studies side. 
Hmm... maybe Paul Smeets (a good friend and collaborator) would have some suggestions for this. He runs a whole ‘center for sustainable finance’, but he is very much a skeptical/critical thinker on this. 

Ben Balmford  Paul Smeets suggested Julian Kolbel — I took a look, and I agree (see, e.g., “Do investors care about impact?“). If we still need evaluators, maybe reach out to Julian, and mention Paul suggested him?
When we ask these people, let’s also remember to request their suggestions for other potential evaluators

david reinstein thanks for this, it is much appreciated. I think what I will do is write to Paul and someone else I have found (called Allen Huang) off my personal email address with you in CC (so as to avoid the spam-y look problem). I am then also going away next Wed for 4.5 weeks - the first 2 are leave and I wont have access to email during that time, the second 2.5 I should have occassional access, so if something needs doing during that time (ie emailing people that they suggest, or sending official puppub invites) would you be ok to do that?

FWIW, Yoon Kim at MIT also looked like someone with expertise in large language models (although much less knowledge about the finance side of things)

",,,,,,7,52 days,,"DR Ben Balmford At a quick read, it seemed like a strong and detailed evaluation. Shows a careful reading of the paper. Some substantive technical discussion an critiques. Also seems to consider our ratings carefully.  Less strong in terms of considering tangible policy implications IMO: why should ‘biodiversity risk priced into assets’ cause market forces to limit these risks?  And what’s the actual policy response either way?

I’d say it’s about 85th percentile (i.e., top 15th percentile) of the evaluations we get.  

BB:
Hi. Quality of evaluation - yes, a very decent one. Interesting that it doesnt criticise the measure at all, almost accepts that if there is co-movement it must be picking up something real (true) but does not critique that that something real might not actually be biodiversity, but rather broader environmental issues.

On policy: I am not really sure what I think the policy response necessarily is. For sure, there needs to be better reg[ulation] of the standards associated with ESG style finance (it is a wild west ATM where each ratings-agency-like-body will give very different ratings allowing people to shop around + suggesting the standards are capturing very little of the signal).
DR: And that’s even assuming ESG ratings make a difference
Second, my personal view is that biodiversity (and climate to a lesser extent) risks/opportunities are actually so far off (and therefore hard to predict at the firm level) that actually they should not broadly be being priced in at the moment. Moreover, exposed to risk =/= doing the damage, so even if priced in, there are equity concerns. Both of which are really arguments for govt involvement in the regulation of the damage - the argument which broadly says that esg investing will solve this is unlikely to hold

Some concerns were raised about potential lack of vetting or replication.

There is substantial debate over the effectiveness of deworming relative to other impactful interventions like bednets. Evidence for the effectiveness of deworming, seems to be far more uncertain with much greater confidence intervals than for other interventions. Previous work, particular, focusing on the long-term impact, seems to be inconsistent, or in some cases seemed face-value implausible. See fairly non-technical discussions:

"," UBI has been talked about quite extensively in policy circles as well, and this paper [has the potential to contribute to] the evidence on its effects in developing country contexts. [Note, the authors]  are only reporting short-term results for the current study. ...Already featured on a website that provides policy evidence on UBI. 
Also, the paper was discussed HERE on the EA Forum
","The paper presents an important (and impressive) randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the impact of different timing structures of unconditional cash transfers (or universal basic income) in Kenya.​ There are two important aspects of the paper that make it suitable for evaluation at the Unjournal: the first is the clear linkage to global priorities research and the fact that the authors include individuals from GiveDirectly, an NGO providing UCTs globally and generating an evidence-based approach for giving. The second is that from a knowledge perspective, the findings need to be critically evaluated to better understand what we can learn from RCTs on UBI in the context of Kenya. Given that RCTs are typically considered the “gold standard” of evidence (not just in economics or policy research, but increasingly among policy stakeholders in the Global South). 
The study compares three arms: a lump sum transfer, a UBI over two years, and a two-year transfer with the promise of ten years of additional transfers. ​ Each participant received $3,000 in transfers over the study period, with the long-term arm expecting an additional $15,000. ​ The RCT aims to understand how the timing of transfers affects the outcomes, such as work behavior and investment decisions. As Evaluator 1 points out, the study's scale is noteworthy, with nearly 23,000 treated adults and a cost of approximately USD 70 million, making it more comparable to a government program than a standard economics RCT. ​ The findings have implications for policymakers designing benefit structures and organizations like GiveDirectly, who routinely produce evidence at varied levels that could also serve as avenues for future evaluation of applied work at the Unjournal. Evaluating this paper, therefore, gives us an opportunity to better situate such policy evidence in the context of other similar work at GiveDirectly and other non-profits. 
Both evaluations agree that the work is likely to make a critical impact on what works in poverty reduction or alleviation within the realm of development economics. The second evaluation especially highlights some of the concerns around causal inference from the claims made by the authors, and provides useful insights on how best to consider these. In particular, the claims around the effects of UBI on well-being and consumption merit some more careful explanation of mechanisms — perhaps the authors could use some aspects of program design (e.g., access to mental health services etc.) to decompose these effects. There are also many other useful comments from the second evaluator on what the authors could meaningfully consider for improving the paper either as part of the current project itself or as future work.
","David R.: E.g., do we want someone good at modeling of labor provision and investment in low income countries,  familiarity with the literature on cash transfers and UBI experiments, the Kenya environment, the construction derived average treatment effects with interactions, etc.?
AT: Ideally, one evaluator who may be able to comment on the policy side of studying UBI in the developing country context (perhaps even with some past experience with Kenya), and another evaluator who will be able to comment on the experimental design and causal inference aspects of the paper.
",,"Anirudh Tagat  — Florian Habermacher (on our FS team) suggested he would be very interested in being an evaluator for this. “I've worked quite a bit on UBI questions, written some of the more down-to-earth analysis on some implementations foreseen”
We don't have a strictly  policy on when we will reach out to internal people. It's certainly not a complete prohibition, but we also don't want to be a bubble. In the past as you know we've done this where in need. In theproposed COI doc I wrote:

Members of our team who did not suggest the paper as evaluators:  We will slightly favor choosing evaluators who are not members of The Unjournal’s team; however, this is not a strong consideration; members of our team generally serve as only one of four or more votes to prioritize a paper.","Following the discussion on Slack, it might be good to keep Nathan (who suggested the paper) as backup and scout for other evaluators who would be able to speak to this paper. As discussed above, considering someone who has past work in Kenya and broadly studying labor.

Anirudh Tagat I believe the second listed evaluator is Shobit K. He is one of our field specialists. That’s OK, but we will need to remember to note this in the output as per our COI policies. 

Also, he told me he was overloaded on evaluation management. I wonder if he will be able to make the deadline for this — worth checking in with him.
David Reinstein: I was hoping to hear from Shobhit, but since it has been a while I have gone ahead and invited Florian.

AT: The first evaluation provides a broad overview of the policy importance of universal cash transfers / universal basic income, which the paper studies using an RCT. It is a helpful contextualization of where such evidence might be useful, but also what might be some of the key factors to consider in weighing this evidence alongside others for policymakers. Since the evaluation did not come from an academic economist, it is reasonably light on methodological issues, but it is otherwise quite sound in terms of policy contexts. 
Ranking: 65th percentile
DR: Fair points. But I would have liked to see a bit more careful critique of the claims and limitations of the work.","Note

JJ:
I found the internal list of potential evaluators (which seems good to stick with if possible, since they have expressed interest) -
DR:
Thanks Julian Jamison Internal list — we do try to prioritize this, but we typically end up going off-list to get the relevant expertise.  We also need to promote signing up for this better, and curate the list better natural (lots of natural scientists, non-researchers etc) ... something I’m working on.  
JJ: 
“should I be trying to avoid asking people who already have assignments?” 

DR: 
in principle yes,  but that’s not likely to be a big problem at the moment. There’s no super-easy way to check for this now (I can do it but I need to make it easier for others)  — that’s something we should work on. Davit Jintcharadze and I plan to do a better job of maintaining, curating, and linking the evaluator content here in the Coda soon. But for now, don’t worry about that. 

JJ:
Also I noticed that e.g. Michael Wiebe / Robert Kubinec / Mattie Toma were considered along with me as EMs for this one (if I’m reading it correctly?), who do seem like very good fits, so would it make sense just to start with say two of them?
DR: 
Our general policy is to try to seek evaluators outside of our team first, and then look inside our team if it seems like it’s higher value. The thinking: we generally don’t want to be an echo chamber, and we ~don’t want the same people to both select/prioritize and evaluate the paper. That said, I see pros and cons here, and we don’t rule out people on our team being the evaluators. 


JJ:
All this makes sense - maybe I should have first asked what exactly it meant to see Michael / Robert / Mattie in the list for this paper? I had interpreted that as “other people who were considered for the EM role, but who hadn’t been involved with choosing or prioritizing this particular paper” (since that was my own position). I agree probably best to avoid the latter group also being the evaluators unless absolutely necessary, but it didn’t seem like that applied here... ? [I get that they are still part of the ‘internal team’ however]

DR: 
Yeah I think that’s mostly right. 
We chose them (or you) as potential evaluation managers 
We usually don’t want to choose the person who originally suggested the paper as the EM, but it’s sometimes OK as long as others have had a say as well and endorsed it
These people are also ‘on our team’, so they still had some role in prioritizing the paper etc. There’s a slight preference for finding someone from outside our team to be the evaluator, but it’s not an overwhelming preference

See our suggested COI policies here, especially the table of roles. For this pairing  (member of team & evaluator) I noted “OK but not ideal. Report.”
JJ:
So my task is: suggest (and then contact via PubPub) two relevant evaluators, starting by considering people on the existing list (but not from the Unjournal team itself) and going beyond that as/if needed.

DR: 
yes, you don’t need to prioritize the existing list too much, just a little. 

Please contact them via pubpub we also advise sending another email from your own address as PubPub has a tendency to go to the spam box.

And you can ‘overbook’ a little bit; say, invite 3 or 4 if you only need 2, as response rates are fairly low. (We usually get a yes from about 1 in 4 or 1 in 5; higher if it’s people you have connection to, of course)","Kris Gulati you mentioned “dig into the empirics to ensure it’s robust” — any issues to flag in particular?
",,,,,,52 days,,"DR: Julian Jamison I just noticed evaluation 1 was in. If you like, you could give feedback on it now, and even an assessment of ‘where the quality of evaluation ranks as a percentile relative to our general pool.’  We do this both to inform ‘who gets bonuses and prizes’. Also to let us know if the evaluators need to be consulted again to clarify or improve their work. And if the evaluations are less than adequate we usually add a third evaluator.  I have not read it yet, but a small comment is that I’d encourage the evaluator to reconsider their ratings , considering their uncertainty in a more Bayesian way, and look at the rating a bit more carefully 
In  particular, they gave a “0” with a CI “0,0” for ‘where should this be published’. As you know a Bayesian posterior (under some general conditions) never converges to absolute certainty. 
The midpoint “0” also seems dubious; not because I have any particular reason to think this paper  is very good (or bad), but because if you look at how we consider the journal tier and the examples we give, even tier 1 is a pretty low standard. 
At a glance it looks like a substantive evaluation, at least :). 
Ah wait, I now see this is an evaluation by a member of our team, and he has access to this data. So let’s not rate him, and we can discuss it with him less formally.

","DR: I skimmed this; I’m almost ready to give the go-ahead but I have some doubts (I’m not including doubts about the research methods/quality itself per se, because we decided that within the space of ‘influential/prestigious work on impactful topics’ this would not be a factor for prioritization).Some (related) concerns:
Is it truly influential? Is it likely to be considered by policymakers and foundations allocating funds? (Even as an indirect/second consideration in terms of the ‘nature of projects to fund’)
Are there clear policy implications of this?
Does the nature of their empirical results (if deemed credible) yield insights for policy and allocations?
If there are no further comments, I’m leaning towards having it evaluated. While the policy implications are not super-obvious, I can see this informing educational and psychological interventions and curricula (e.g., ‘abundance mentality’ coaching’).

 I worked with Monica Jain on a systematic review about childhood education. Monica leads work with GAVI and COVAX and has a background in economics. . . but, I am not quite sure why that would be relevant as it seems an epidemiologist would be more in line. Still, Monica could be a good bet or might know someone who is.

For reviewers of this paper, on the cost-benefit side, I'd check if CHE has anyone who has done any Epi work https://www.york.ac.uk/che - ( I notice andrew.mirelman@york.ac.uk, who is now at WHO, seems like a possible candidate.)

DR: This seems very relevant in terms of impact but it’s mainly epidemiological – is that in our wheelhouse?
DR, responding to others’ comments – OK, I’m going to push this forward to ‘looking for evaluation manager’ but we can put some asterisks on this one that we are proceeding tentatively, and only if we seem able to find good evaluators with relevant expertise in epidemiology etc.
Note I pushed this forward even though it’s ‘average final rating’ was below 4.0 because it ticks so many of our boxes (author submitted, open science, cuts across important causes and priorities) it allows us to learn about ‘whether we can handle this type of paper’ I suspect that some of your ratings would have been higher ‘conditional on us finding good epi evaluators’

Michael Wiebe Given your work on the “measles paper”, I was wondering if you think you/we could handle ‘evaluation managing’ this (note the concerns about it’s epidemiological focus). Perhaps we could get some guidance or cooperation from the authors of that paper, or maybe from people like Carl Bonander

From The Unjournal’s prioritization assessor: 
This report develops a quantitive model of the returns of bioscience [and biotech] in the presence of catastrophic risks. The modelling is based on estimates from superforecasters and domain experts in Tetlock’s Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament and integrates various existential risk concepts (e.g. time of perils). ... the results are used to provide metascience policy advice.
The report finds that the expected social returns of bioscience research are x230 compared to cash transfers (to middle-class Americans?). However, this is offset by a small (~5%) extinction risk. The overall conclusion of the report ... may reassure EAs concerned who advocate for slowing down bioscience research to mitigate GCBRs, and influence the investments such EAs make in biorisk reduction. 
This question seems of obvious policy importance, given the tremendous amount of government and charitable finding for science especially biotech, and given prominently expressed doubts about this, citing catastrophic risks.
This report influenced Open Philanthropy, a major funder, and may influence them in the future
This is an internal report Matt Clancy, head of Open Philanthropy’s Innovation Policy Program (IPP).  OP was broadly considering whether they, (through IPP&  perhaps more broadly) should support the advancement of science and technology. 
According to Matt, the report was an important input into their decision (among others?).  He says that through this report and broader discussion, they adopted a moderate position on ‘whether to support advancing tech’, in between two poles.
Positive pole: ‘full steam ahead, accelerate science, remove bottlenecks’
Negative pole: advancements are very dangerous. Try to steer it, don’t try to accelerate it; maybe try to slow some areas.
The ‘middle’  position they adopted:  IPP will do some of both, but perhaps more towards the positive pole (if I understood him correctly)
OP is influential, and their opinions may influence other funders and policymakers
","Unjournal requests 
Consider the choice of discount rates carefully; 
e.g., see the discussions of this on the EA forum here
Does the author fairly characterize his modeling results?
The author states the conclusion something like 
If we ignore “civilization-ending catastrophes” the benefits outweigh forecasted risks under a robust set of plausible assumptions. [Is this truly the case?] 
Considering “civilization-ending catastrophes”/X-risk,  the benefit - cost is not clear, it critically depends on:
which risk estimates are used (see the difference between Tetlock’s superforecasters and experts) 
and (perhaps) on reasonable disagreements about how much value is placed on the long-term future.
[Is it really contingent on these things, or is it actually much more to one side or the other?]
[This was more the ‘author’s take at the end iirc] “Fortunately for us, estimates of how likely this is to occur are small enough that, for the most part, it shouldn’t loom large in our thinking about the value of science; especially if we are actively seeking to reduce those dangers.”
[Is this a fair characterization of what the modeling actually finds?] 
Bonus: Extending this analysis to AI risks 
This is an obvious follow-up, and it would be interesting (although perhaps difficult) for an evaluator to consider how feasible this is based on the current model and the tournament predictions.
Author’s requests, endorsed by The Unjournal
Vetting the calculations and the code. 
Ultimately, no one has vetted the calculations or the code.  At least one evaluator should pour through and audit at least some part of the calculations and the code. Matt thinks this could be high-value. “Any economist could do it.” 
There are two models, one  is derived ‘by hand’ … the equations are in the appendix.  The second model is in a Python program. Shareable … just sums a bunch of cohorts, discounts them, etc..  
Uncertainty: You can choose parameters … but I guess no distributions over these. You can tinker with these in the Google Sheet model.
 “The questions about tech diffusion”
Matt suggests he sees the most value from considering this carefully. Model treats it as simultaneous with (lags?) on the bounds on technology. Is this reasonable and justified in this situation? How robust are the results to this?
Less important: forecasts from the Xrisk Persuasion tournamemt
Matt is less concerned that they interpreted this part wrongly.  He says Ezra Karger has already vetted this aspect.","Relevant expertise

COI considerations
I believe Matt is in a fairly important position at Open Philanthropy; he runs the Innovation Policy program.  OP is a  large funder of relevant research. We might try to find evaluators less likely to apply to OP for funding, and we might encourage them to remain anonymous. This might be a less substantial consideration for a traditional academic.","22 Feb 2024: Matt has been positive and helpful. We’ve had a detailed conversation, and we are following up.

DR Noted we’ve spoken to Matt Clancy a bit.
 I fleshed out some of the content here (see above). We have some definite ideas about who/what/how/why to evaluate this. Next I hope to read the paper itself in more detail. But let’s push on with this once you have the bandwidth.

Joel: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?
What question needs to be asked by when?
There's a lot of information scattered in different emails, pages, messages, comments. Can we stick to one single communication channel, e.g. only by email or only in this comment thread?
DR: Joel Christoph “lot of information” → happy to discuss this only in the boxes above
DR: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?” Joel Christoph I’m not sure if you are asking a broad or a narrow question here. I discuss this on our page here in a general sense. For the ’policy stream’, the main goals are the first and third ones mentioned there.

“Crafting evaluations and ratings that help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research. For Research Users.”

“Providing constructive feedback to Authors”

In the boxes above, I raise some specific issues I would like evaluators to consider above, and Matt also raised some

What question needs to be asked by when?
Not sure what you are asking here.  We give the evaluators autonomy. However, we do make recommendations.I guess that’s what we need to decide now. Which questions should evaluators tackle, and how should we  divide this between the evaluators. Of course that depends on the expertise and interests of the evaluators we manage to get.. 
Joel and David had a face to face chat on this. 
JC noted:
1. I share your concerns about the length and formatting potentially deterring our evaluators. Let's narrow our focus further or ask Matt to streamline the document to clearly delineate the sections for each evaluator and highlight the essential parts our focus.
2. I note that we are evaluating this paper to help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research AND to provide constructive feedback to the author.

DR: Joel Christoph I moved this paper back to ‘awaiting author update’ based on the recent response from Matt Clancy, until we hear from him or decide to move forward
On March Matt proposed a delay “a month or two” for some updates (proposed on May 8, not sure how long the delay is).  Checkin date April 25?
Update 25 April — Matt promised a new version would be up in 2 weeks.

Update May 9 — Matt shared a new version. Joel Christoph let’s move forward on this.
