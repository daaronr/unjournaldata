No CI given for 'Open, collaborative, replicable', but seems uncertain as to whether this is a meaningful category here. I will code this as low confidence
Wrote 'NA' for the journal quality metric; but also wrote '3.5', which I'm including, because the situation he describes is what we wanted to elicit here 
Journal merit: I coded 'medium-high' as confidence 4
