A range of interventions aimed at influencing individual behavior have been considered, but there is very limited evidence on whether these are successful. Indeed, effective altruism linked animal welfare advocates have moved away from this approach in favor of corporate campaigns. 
However, this may be from a lack of evidence rather than evidence that these interventions are ineffective.  Of course, there may be heterogeneity; these may be more effective for some audiences than others. The extent to which these initiatives and ads are targeted towards seekers, neutral people, or even potential avoiders seems actionable and potentially consequential. E.g., we could compare ‘push’ vs ‘pull’ marketing, ads targeted towards those showing interest in animals versus more neutral or ‘surprise’ ads etc. 

The authors work seems to potentially have several rare and valuable aspects
 a credible strategy for differentiating the effects of such information/stimuli on avoiders versus seekers, in a way that seems robust to differential selection issues.  
incentivized choices (of food vouchers)
more consequential field evidence (linked to the lab experiment treatments?), with perhaps less potential for demand effects, temporary agreeability bias, etc.

In a general sense, The Unjournal is seeking to stimulate more rigorous social science research  relevant to animal welfare, including a focus on consumption attitudes.  This is one of our first forays in this direction.","Consistent with The Unjournal’s stated mission, and approach... We are  interested in the specific applied and empirical questions, and in the implications of this for animal welfare marketing interventions, and interventions in adjacent areas. We are somewhat less interested in the deep behavioral question of whether “individuals who prefer to avoid information are particularly responsive to it” (also noting that this latter relationship may itself be heterogeneous across groups and contexts) .
Consider the internal validity and external generalizability of this work. 
Are the causal claims plausible?  Do they do the WTP elicitation appropriately? 
Do they apply inverse probability weighting correctly to estimate the treatment effects?
In generalizing — Is this context reasonably representative of what future interventions are likely to involve?
To what extent are the results credibly suggest implications for longer-term diet changes (or attitudes towards animal welfare measures, perhaps)? 
How substantial are the incentives, and how well does the data capture important choices? 
How does the field data supplement the lab responses? Are there complimentary strengths and weaknesses of each?  Does the field data credibly address concerns about temporary effects, agreeableness bias, demand effects etc?
Is bias from selective attrition an issue?
Do the authors report the estimates that would be useful to animal welfare advocacy organizations? Are their other measures you would like to see reported?","Using Inverse Probability Weighting in causal inference/treatment effects

This paper studies the long-term effects of the 1963 US measles vaccine, and is relevant for funding vaccines in developing countries. Previous research on this question uses reported measles cases as a proxy for disease burden. This paper improves on the literature by explicitly accounting for reporting rates. It uses two models: (1) a reduced-form ‘disease burden’ approach, regressing long-term economic outcomes on pre-vaccine measles mortality (cross-sectional) interacted with vaccine exposure (time series); (2) an epidemiological SIR model, designed to capture geographic variation in actual cases immediately before the vaccine. It finds positive effects for the reduced-form model, consistent with previous papers, but not for the epidemiological model. 
","The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the reduced-form approach. From the abstract: “Our results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic literature.”
The reduced-form approach in the literature  in the literature uses reported incidence.  Chuard (2022) uses mortality in their reduced-form model, while other papers use reported incidence. Pre-vaccine mortality could arguably be a proxy for this.  But the authors don’t seem to consider whether pre-vaccine mortality correlates with reported incidence. Does this matter? 
They authors claim that reported incidence is a proxy for disease burden. Is this justified? Could they test this empirically?
How does the concept of  ‘disease burden’ apply to a universal disease like measles (with nearly 100% infection rates). In light of this, what is the identifying variation?
Do the authors clearly state their identifying assumptions? Is their identification justified? 
They do not present an event study to test for pre-trends — is this an important limitation?

Some discussion of interpretation of ratings, MW’s as a ‘strong yes’. JJ’s ‘weak no’ because “result didn’t sound likely to change / influence how we think about things” ... but we recommended it anyways

 Yes, I reached out to him politely and he responded a bit rudely, tbh. This represents a broader issue that we are tackling — should the evaluation managers and the management  ‘moderate’ the metrics in some way?

Not sure  what this has to do with LASSO; I guess they meant something else in the abstract. Also ‘cannot reject’ can simply be a lack of power; is this approach theoretically grounded?
Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winner’s curse. — interesting, evaluator should consider if their correction is the right one. 
Incentives vs reminders etc... this would seem to inform charities like “New Incentives”

IIRC the seasonal labour migration is generally accepted to not scale very well, so Givewell might not find much value in extra evaluation.
DR: @Gavin Taylor it still might be worth exploring further: 1. as a general issue, 2. because the NLS ‘failure’ (as stated by Givewell: https://blog.givewell.org/2019/06/06/evidence-action-is-shutting-down-no-lean-season/#2017Study)  seemed to be largely about management issues and evidence that it didn’t actually lead to net emigration … but effects of emigration (if it indeed could be influenced) could still be  helpful to know  3. to understand ‘why it failed’ if so.  We don’t want to ‘overlearn’ or learn the wrong lessons.

The authors here (quick look) seem to claim the transportation subsidies they offered had an impact on migration. Could be useful to better understand the discrepancy, if there is one.
That said, I’m thinking this paper is probably not up-to-date so maybe. worth waiting to see if something else comes out
@david reinstein yeah, I didn’t check if the authors had any newer publications on the intervention. The senior author (Mobarak) does have other publications on migration (some in NBER), could be worth reaching out to see if he would be interested in having work evaluated and could suggest the most relevant
https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KRXr5_oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate

Tangentially, I liked this comment that Mobarak wrote recently about the difficulties of scaling up interventions (basically based on his experience with the seasonal labour migration RCTs)

As it’s in the US its arguably not a ‘global priority’ in terms of targeting the desperate poor. However,  1. It seems adjacent and relevant to things like Give Directly, and 2. the scale of the potential benefit is large (UBI is a big global policy issue), and it relates to a potential big transformation of society.

These also often relevant to important/impactful global health interventions (see e.g., this Guardian article), as well as  measures to control the spread of pandemics.   (But we have some disagreement about how impactful the nudge parts of the interventions are.]
We also had some doubts about the particular concerns about nudges expressed in this paper in terms of their importance in a global impact sense. 
At least at a skim, the paper assumes/considers a case where the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies. Thus the impact of nudges 'in equilibrium with the government response' has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the 'best compromise'.  This approach to the question is fairly standard from a public economics pov. 
The issue still seems a bit less than first-order.

But arguments about this may still be influential. We perceive some important pushbacks against the ‘nudge agenda’, and this may be a fairly central issue.  The authors are prominent and there is some chance that the paper itself will influence policy, perhaps entering into the considerations of ‘nudge units’ or the arguments made against particular interventions. 
“It is quite a substantive paper and I think an evaluation could get into both the theory and details of the experiments”
","Some issues that came to me (David R.) after a skim of the paper:
Is a model in which government adjusts taxes/subsidies optimally a relevant one for this discussion? Do their arguments meaningfully carry over to a more general environment?
“Welfare also depends on whether the NPI reduces the variance of distortions from heterogenous biases and externalities, and the average effect becomes irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes.”
Is this main argument correct, are there flaws in it, is it robust to relevant small modifications in the theoretical model?
“We apply our framework to randomized experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels ...” These experiments were run on a particular pool of participants, asking questions about particular contexts. 
Are the inferences made from these participants in this context meaningful? Does the experiment itself add any ‘value of information’? I.e., do we know more about something important in the real world, adjusting or concentrating our beliefs, after having seen the results of the experiment 
(If so) do the results in this context meaningfully generalize in ways that will help inform (globally) important real-world policies?  
There were some real incentives to choose according to one’s true preferences (in the drinks case?) or to get state WTP ‘correctly’ as imputed from their earlier survey responses (in the autos case).   
Were these incentives strong, meaningful, and correctly aligned?
... Usual considerations about statistical modeling of the results, statistical inferences, structure of any structural (?) model used to derive welfare implications; consistency with pre-registration/pre-analysis plan

","David R – I’d particularly value evaluators with:
an applied understanding of public finance/public econ. theory, considering normative issues
experience considering the value of framed choice experiments and elicitations like this, and how generalizable they are to real world markets of interest. ",,,,,,5,,"DR: I partially disagree with Ryan in that I think that these nudges may have rather large effects on key health and environment behaviors, or at least policymakers may think they do and improving the PMs’  beliefs may have a lot of of value. However, the lab-like nature of the evidence may limit its influence and impact (even though the authors are fairly prominent). The theoretical part of their work might have more influence, but I’m not sure.
OK reading a bit more,~~ the ‘second order effects of nudge on equilibrium prices distorting choices’~~ aspect, seems like it might be fairly unimportant in a global impact sense. Correction – their model assumes (?) the government is adding optimal taxes/subsidies, and thus the impact of nudges ‘in equilibrium with the government response’ has something to do with the extent that it makes the *net* distortion in preferences (after misinformation, biases, etc.) have more variance, making tax/subsidy policy less able to achieve the ‘best compromise’.  This still seems a bit less than first-order, but perhaps somewhat more consequential.
[And also/on the other hand] if the ‘paper itself will influence policy’ (which I’m not convinced about) it could be impactful for us to have this evaluated, and beneficial for us to engage.

~All content shared in “Bespoke evaluation notes”
","Karger suggestions
‘Is this generally important?’ 
Is the data/release of the data useful?  [where can we find this]
Did they explain it well?
 
Digging into the subresults:  A handful of experts in any topic. Very few in some areas. AI has a few more.  They have specific subsections for each topic area. 
We could ask experts ‘are they correctly describing the debates in this space?’ Did they ask the right questions? Are these really people with the right expertise?
We don’t need to do our usual ‘pay two evaluators’ 

FRI ‘next steps’ post
FRI  made an EA Forum post seeking input on the next steps, for their next version. Some of these suggest things to evaluate, especially... 
1. Deliberation/consensus-building process: They expected “deliberation and argument would lead forecasters to update on one another’s beliefs and arguments and eventually converge on similar probabilities.” But this did not occur on questions where they disagreed most.
Were their expectations wrong here? Does previous work suggest this convergence would not happen? 
Were their methods of facilitating deliberation insufficient? Are there better approaches they should use?
[AH] Was the entire protocol designed such that shifting was a natural thing to do?
2. Methods of eliciting low-probability forecasts: ~ ’People are bad and inconsistent at giving probability forecasts for rare events’. This may apply to area experts and superforecasters too.  
How should we expect this to have biased or frustrated their approach?
What are some better methods for eliciting these rare event forecasts, training people to be better at them, and measuring reliability of forecasters (for weighting the forecasts) in this domain? 
[AH: there is a literature on earthquake elicitation etc. — Annemarie Christophersen from GNS science, NZ would know loads about that]

Unjournal suggestions for issues to evaluate
'Reciprocal scoring':  Is the 'reciprocal scoring' rule likely to motivate honest (incentive-compatible) predictions? Is it likely to generate useful information in this context?
For all this to generate value, they seem to rely a lot on being able to compare reciprocal accuracy to real-world accuracy starting in 2024. [AH is there enough evidence to suggest reciprocal accuracy is a good predictor of real accuracy? ]This suggests that if these does correlate (in certain ways), they will then look to the remaining ‘reciprocal data’ to make predictions about the real world for events further in the future. But is this reasonable? Did their study really produce data that will enable them to powerfully consider this and reliably make inferences?
[AH] there are a couple of results showing that how people present themselves is very (positively) correlated with how they are perceived and scored by their peers,  but there’s no correlation between that ranking and the performance in terms of accuracy, calibration or informativeness.

more accurate reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk 

But is this meaningful, or is it just simply that the unusual people who thought there is high X-risk thought others are likely to think the same? Is it more finely grained 'better reciprocal accuracy' than that?
Also, this correlation seems to hold visually, but I don't see metrics or statistical inference here. 
Is there a lack of statistical power?

Recruitment etc.:
Was the choice of ‘experts’ reasonable?  Were the other groups recruited in ways that would tilt them towards one side or the other, or towards being intransigent? Were there ‘cultural things’ going on; do Superforecasters have particular characteristics or biases that might make them especially optimistic about x-risk, or to be hostile to the arguments of effective altruists and x-risk doomsayers? And vice/versa?
Were there implementation issues in the recruitment of superforecasters, as this thread suggests?
[AH] were superforecasters identified as such, for them and for other groups?
Should we be concerned about a potential bias due to the substantial attrition?

Prediction question choice and framing: 
Were the prediction questions relevant? 
Were they well-framed?
They seem to have displayed these along with particular “Prior Forecasts” — is that appropriate? Could that be driving the persistent difference between the superforecasters and experts?
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] Framing of ‘questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks’ — 
I suspect there is a prior literature on ‘eliciting policy choices’ from the public and policymaker participants. Did they set this up well?

Other survey/experimental methods issues
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact...]  “Public survey of 912 college graduates” — 
This ‘general population survey’ is obviously a well-studied method. Did they do this well (recruiting methods, survey elicitation instrument, etc.)?

Statistical analysis and reporting: 
Is the focus on the median forecast and the bootstrapped confidence interval the right choice here (their argument for this is rather informal)? 
What about the other aggregation methods they use? Which seems most useful, or is another approach warranted? True ‘the large gaps between expert and superforecaster beliefs are robust across aggregation methods’, and it appears so in the tables they show. However, it would be helpful to get some expert consideration of this for future work. It is not easy to know if all of the possible results presented are robust to all reasonable aggregation methods.
 Other studies let the aggregation methods compete.  Tetlock’s group often advocates for the extremizing one, which seemed to perform best for near-term followup event.
(See above on “reciprocal scores were correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk.”)
[If this actually matters to the paper’s conclusions or impact] “Assessments of risk were highly correlated” — they present some ad-hoc statistics here, but they don’t really model this. If this correlation indeed holds, is this useful, or is it meant to reflect something else that helps us interpret the results? In either case, is their a better way to statistically model and test this? 

Presentation and communication: 
Visuals and summary statistics: Are there more useful and informative ways of presenting the (differences in) the forecasts? 
Can you recommend some easy ways to add value here? Given the data shared, would it easy to convert this into a hosted ‘dashboard’ style?

Overriding issues
What exactly was the goal of this project and this analysis? To generate the highest quality forecasts? If so, what is the case for their particular approach.
Did they preregister?

Other methodology things (integrate above)
Why is the protocol the way it is? Why the separate groups and then the mixed groups?
Did you ask them about uncertainty, why not?
Was the discussion synchronous and is there any analysis about synchronous  vs. asynchronous conditioning for convergence results.

ChatGPT outline of paper

Recruitment and participation details.
Results
Differences in risk estimation between experts and superforecasters, with the largest gaps in AI risk assessments.
Insights into the challenges of changing minds and achieving consensus on existential risks.
Discussion and Conclusion
Reflections on the implications of persistent disagreements among forecasters.
Suggestions for future research directions, especially on improving forecasting accuracy and understanding forecasters' belief systems.
Appendices
Detailed methodology, data analysis, and additional context on existential risk forecasting.

Parts of the paper to skip or skim
Although the paper appears very long, much of it could be skipped or skimmed. A lot is background for lay people that our evaluators are likely to already know. Much also  involves detailed descriptive presentation of the results. The appendix largely involves repeated tables of results/data and the complete survey instrument. We mainly want the evaluators to focus on the methodology of the study design, the approach to presenting the results, the statistical analysis (or lack thereof), and the high level inferences and implications drawn from the evidence collected. The evaluators could also weigh in on the particular x-risk areas that they may have expertise in, considering whether these were presented meaningfully.
“Background & motivation” ... (for a lay audience)
“Comparing experts to superforecasters” (for a lay audience)
Results — a lot of space in the main text is devoted to graphing and tabling these differences, along with the same notes each time. This can go quickly.
“How the XPT results compare to prior risk estimates” — this  section is less in need of methodological expert evaluation (although experts on these particular risk areas might be consulted to check if the sources are reputable and authoritative)
“Contrasting experts and superforecasters in different domains” largely recaps what we saw/heard before, with some layman’s explanation
Questions about how they would allocate resources to mitigate potential risks — interesting but may not benefit from expert evaluation (but see question above)
“Relationships between risk predictions in different domains” — this seems to involve some ad-hoc descriptive statistics ... not sure how useful these are to pore over, if there are no real implications here.
“How time spent thinking about existential risk relates to forecasts of those risks” (obvious/boring IMO)
“Individual risk areas” — each evaluator could read/skim through two of these. (Evaluators with particular expertise on these risk areas should also comment on the appropriateness of the discussion and framing).",,,,,,,7,,"DR: Note it’s a 751 page pdf (only about 75 pages up to the bibliography, about 22k words); perhaps they have a better web interface; we would need to consider how to have it evaluated.
DR: I’m going to consider it in our ‘nonacademic stream’ perhaps; it’s going to target academia at some point, but I don’t think the current version could be assessed in that way
GT: I voted no because I thought that 750 pages was too big for us to meaningfully evaluate with our current procedure. But looking back, I see that the main body of the report is only goes to page 75, and about 500 pages is appendix 7. So as long as we don’t expect anybody to go through the appendices in detail it seems ambitious but possible for an evaluator.
For these long reports (also Matt’s Returns to Science one) I think we might want to give evaluators some specific guidelines about what to cover, rather than just going through everything as they might for a peer review(I’m not sure sure how academic book publishers do peer review any differently from journal publishers, but I assume their mandate is usually to cover everything)
DR: I agree Gavin. I propose
We have it evaluated as a non-academic-stream output.
We carefully limit which aspects/sections we ask evaluators to consider
I think scoping this out and evaluating managing this will be considerable work. So I’m thinking that I’ll both look for an evaluation manager (maybe paying a little extra) and help them by doing a lot of this work myself.

Incorporating from comments
I spoke with Ezra, he is cooperative

DR: Reading the paper
From what I’m seeing, there’s a real lack of formal technical content. Even though the paper is very long in pages, its a lot of repetition, simple background for a lay audience, and repeated presentations of tables of results and question instruments (~putting all the data into a pdf :)).
I think we should be able to identify a limited set of issues the evaluators could focus on.
[I did this]
AH:
agreed...for now, i added some notes and some links to evaluators from the expert judgement community

Samara: This is a topic I think about a lot but don’t necessarily work on, so I don’t know how relevant the paper is for my work (or others). However, there are a few things in the paper that would be interesting to evaluate further.
In terms of the topic, I think there’s a wide interest in concentration in the meat industry. But I have some open questions that may imply the topic isn’t very relevant to people’s work:
To what degree can animal advocates/EAs affect the concentration of the animal agriculture industry?
To what degree is concentration more harmful than diffusion for non-human animals? I’ve been wondering this for a long time, and I’m not totally sure (and there’s only a little research on it). It seems to be mostly bad for humans, so I suspect on net it’s more harmful, but maybe I’m wrong or at least wrong in the case of animal welfare. I guess this is an argument for more research into the overall effects of concentration-reducing policies, but that’s not really the point of this paper.
If you think the topic is relevant, I think there are some details worth examining in the paper.
Did the authors conduct any sensitivity analysis on the demand elasticity parameter (they don’t report it), and if so what were the results?  There are a few reasons that I could believe that their choice of demand elasticity was hasty, but it may not change their conclusions much.
This might be outside the scope of the evaluation process, but I’m curious what might the theoretical model look like with a different definition of resilience? Specifically, one that included some measure of animal welfare and non-consumer human welfare as they’re affected by these exogenous events and subsequent closures (like the mass livestock cullings that happened in early 2020 as a result of plant closures, or plant worker stress associated with having to work extra hours during the pandemic in plants that didn’t close). This might all fall under the welfare analysis section (i.e., including animals in the social welfare function, or adding cost of worker injury/illness, etc) or it might need a overhaul of the theory model. I didn’t look to hard at that model.
Looking more closely at all of the (many) assumptions throughout the paper could be warranted.
My question about concentration/market power and animal welfare generally revolves around the factors you mentioned: political influence, stocking density, worker training, access to health care, etc. There’s some work on it, but I don’t have strong sense of the net harm to animals from concentration.
It seems the demand elasticity point is the most tractable for review, and also probably the easiest to just email the authors lol … instead of conducting a full evaluation.",Markets for products with large externalities (focus: animal agriculture),Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,01_Needs prioritization/assessor rating,,"animal welfare,economics",,,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,55%,,60%,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,,"Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains,Concentration and Resilience in the US Meat Supply Chains",,,,

I liked this article.
KG: I also liked this. I think it has interesting ramifications on long-run scientific progress, and I wonder if there’s a way of framing AI alignment in the early stages of this, which may have spillovers. I don’t think it’s a standard economics paper, and I think my confidence intervals on this paper are pretty wide but I’ve put a high percentage here despite this
GT: To be honest, despite all the attention, this got, it reads more like a policy paper than empirical research to me. There seem to be a lot of analogies used to describe their model of effort vs. impact, but the only data is in Fig. 7, to support their claim that novelty is weakly correlated with citations (I do like the fact they are measuring novelty with a textual analysis). I feel that most of the effort in an evaluation would be to check that their sources/analogies actually do support their model and then provides sufficient justification for their proposals - overall this seems like it will be quite subjective.
DR: Gave it a quick skim. Looked like anecdotes + very toy model + opinion + maybe a very quick empirical exercise (which could have been interesting if they had gone into more detail).
This does seem interesting for our own consideration of prioritization – do they give any formal measurable definition of ‘scientific impact’, though?
My impression is also that, even though these are ‘NBER authors’ this was not a fully-baked effort.","Innovation, meta-science, and research",Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,02_final consideration needed,,,,,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,,2024-04-12T07:27:20.597-04:00,80%,60%,67%,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,,"Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives,Stagnation and Scientific Incentives",2024-05-19T00:00:00.000-04:00,,,

We all realize that this might be good publicity for the idea, which is nice.
 
One coauthor, perhaps stating a downside that won’t surprise Unjournal founders, is that there is always the chance of negative comments, which is ok, that’s what academic debate is for. Perhaps the concern is that there is a slim chance that a negative comment rises to the level of requiring some response, sucking up time authors are short on. The hope is that that is unlikely , but is possible, and is outweighed by the benefits of coverage. In any event, that wasn’t a reason not to participate since we realize that authors don’t have veto power over how the paper is used!

>  Specifically, when a treated firm committed a violation, citizen volunteers who cooperated with our experiment filed an appeal through one of two broadly-defined channels: (1) private appeals where the citizens complained to the regulator or the firm about the violation in ways that could not be observed by other members of the public; (2) public appeals where the citizens complained about the violation on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform that is comparable to Twitter. In total, the experiment intervened against nearly 3,000 pollution violations.
> Specifically, we randomized the
visibility of social media appeals about a violation by experimentally adding 10 additional “likes” and “shares” to the Weibo post, which would otherwise obtain 0.66 “likes” and “shares” naturally.
> if anything, the interventions might have created positive spillover effects. For example, the relative probability of a violation was either unchanged or lower among the control and treatment firms in the higher intensity prefectures, although the reduced violation rates are not always statistically significant by conventional criteria
DR: I’d like to see a CI or posterior distribution over these effects and differences, considering the policy implications
DR: In deciding whether to evaluate:
1. Is there any actionable intervention here? Can China/outsiders/NGOs do anything to encourage or facilitate this sort of citizen participation? Would any ‘intervention’ in this case backfire if the government were aware of this?
2. Is this likely to extend to other governments and policies, and to the future in China, or is it very specific to this one situation (albeit a very important one)

This paper has the potential to be highly influential and very important.
Some concerns were raised about potential lack of vetting or replication.

There is substantial debate over the effectiveness of deworming relative to other impactful interventions like bednets. Evidence for the effectiveness of deworming, seems to be far more uncertain with much greater confidence intervals than for other interventions. Previous work, particular, focusing on the long-term impact, seems to be inconsistent, or in some cases seemed face-value implausible. See fairly non-technical discussions:

[Note, the authors]  are only reporting short-term results for the current study. ...Already featured on a website that provides policy evidence on UBI. 
Also, the paper was discussed HERE on the EA Forum
","The paper presents an important (and impressive) randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the impact of different timing structures of unconditional cash transfers (or universal basic income) in Kenya.​ There are two important aspects of the paper that make it suitable for evaluation at the Unjournal: the first is the clear linkage to global priorities research and the fact that the authors include individuals from GiveDirectly, an NGO providing UCTs globally and generating an evidence-based approach for giving. The second is that from a knowledge perspective, the findings need to be critically evaluated to better understand what we can learn from RCTs on UBI in the context of Kenya. Given that RCTs are typically considered the “gold standard” of evidence (not just in economics or policy research, but increasingly among policy stakeholders in the Global South). 
The study compares three arms: a lump sum transfer, a UBI over two years, and a two-year transfer with the promise of ten years of additional transfers. ​ Each participant received $3,000 in transfers over the study period, with the long-term arm expecting an additional $15,000. ​ The RCT aims to understand how the timing of transfers affects the outcomes, such as work behavior and investment decisions. As Evaluator 1 points out, the study's scale is noteworthy, with nearly 23,000 treated adults and a cost of approximately USD 70 million, making it more comparable to a government program than a standard economics RCT. ​ The findings have implications for policymakers designing benefit structures and organizations like GiveDirectly, who routinely produce evidence at varied levels that could also serve as avenues for future evaluation of applied work at the Unjournal. Evaluating this paper, therefore, gives us an opportunity to better situate such policy evidence in the context of other similar work at GiveDirectly and other non-profits. 
Both evaluations agree that the work is likely to make a critical impact on what works in poverty reduction or alleviation within the realm of development economics. The second evaluation especially highlights some of the concerns around causal inference from the claims made by the authors, and provides useful insights on how best to consider these. In particular, the claims around the effects of UBI on well-being and consumption merit some more careful explanation of mechanisms — perhaps the authors could use some aspects of program design (e.g., access to mental health services etc.) to decompose these effects. There are also many other useful comments from the second evaluator on what the authors could meaningfully consider for improving the paper either as part of the current project itself or as future work.
","David R.: E.g., do we want someone good at modeling of labor provision and investment in low income countries,  familiarity with the literature on cash transfers and UBI experiments, the Kenya environment, the construction derived average treatment effects with interactions, etc.?
AT: Ideally, one evaluator who may be able to comment on the policy side of studying UBI in the developing country context (perhaps even with some past experience with Kenya), and another evaluator who will be able to comment on the experimental design and causal inference aspects of the paper.

DR, responding to others’ comments – OK, I’m going to push this forward to ‘looking for evaluation manager’ but we can put some asterisks on this one that we are proceeding tentatively, and only if we seem able to find good evaluators with relevant expertise in epidemiology etc.
Note I pushed this forward even though it’s ‘average final rating’ was below 4.0 because it ticks so many of our boxes (author submitted, open science, cuts across important causes and priorities) it allows us to learn about ‘whether we can handle this type of paper’ I suspect that some of your ratings would have been higher ‘conditional on us finding good epi evaluators’

From The Unjournal’s prioritization assessor: 
This report develops a quantitive model of the returns of bioscience [and biotech] in the presence of catastrophic risks. The modelling is based on estimates from superforecasters and domain experts in Tetlock’s Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament and integrates various existential risk concepts (e.g. time of perils). ... the results are used to provide metascience policy advice.
The report finds that the expected social returns of bioscience research are x230 compared to cash transfers (to middle-class Americans?). However, this is offset by a small (~5%) extinction risk. The overall conclusion of the report ... may reassure EAs concerned who advocate for slowing down bioscience research to mitigate GCBRs, and influence the investments such EAs make in biorisk reduction. 
This question seems of obvious policy importance, given the tremendous amount of government and charitable finding for science especially biotech, and given prominently expressed doubts about this, citing catastrophic risks.
This report influenced Open Philanthropy, a major funder, and may influence them in the future
This is an internal report Matt Clancy, head of Open Philanthropy’s Innovation Policy Program (IPP).  OP was broadly considering whether they, (through IPP&  perhaps more broadly) should support the advancement of science and technology. 
According to Matt, the report was an important input into their decision (among others?).  He says that through this report and broader discussion, they adopted a moderate position on ‘whether to support advancing tech’, in between two poles.
Positive pole: ‘full steam ahead, accelerate science, remove bottlenecks’
Negative pole: advancements are very dangerous. Try to steer it, don’t try to accelerate it; maybe try to slow some areas.
The ‘middle’  position they adopted:  IPP will do some of both, but perhaps more towards the positive pole (if I understood him correctly)
OP is influential, and their opinions may influence other funders and policymakers

Does the author fairly characterize his modeling results?
The author states the conclusion something like 
If we ignore “civilization-ending catastrophes” the benefits outweigh forecasted risks under a robust set of plausible assumptions. [Is this truly the case?] 
Considering “civilization-ending catastrophes”/X-risk,  the benefit - cost is not clear, it critically depends on:
which risk estimates are used (see the difference between Tetlock’s superforecasters and experts) 
and (perhaps) on reasonable disagreements about how much value is placed on the long-term future.
[Is it really contingent on these things, or is it actually much more to one side or the other?]
[This was more the ‘author’s take at the end iirc] “Fortunately for us, estimates of how likely this is to occur are small enough that, for the most part, it shouldn’t loom large in our thinking about the value of science; especially if we are actively seeking to reduce those dangers.”
[Is this a fair characterization of what the modeling actually finds?] 
Bonus: Extending this analysis to AI risks 
This is an obvious follow-up, and it would be interesting (although perhaps difficult) for an evaluator to consider how feasible this is based on the current model and the tournament predictions.

Vetting the calculations and the code. 
Ultimately, no one has vetted the calculations or the code.  At least one evaluator should pour through and audit at least some part of the calculations and the code. Matt thinks this could be high-value. “Any economist could do it.” 
There are two models, one  is derived ‘by hand’ … the equations are in the appendix.  The second model is in a Python program. Shareable … just sums a bunch of cohorts, discounts them, etc..  
Uncertainty: You can choose parameters … but I guess no distributions over these. You can tinker with these in the Google Sheet model.
 “The questions about tech diffusion”
Matt suggests he sees the most value from considering this carefully. Model treats it as simultaneous with (lags?) on the bounds on technology. Is this reasonable and justified in this situation? How robust are the results to this?
Less important: forecasts from the Xrisk Persuasion tournamemt
Matt is less concerned that they interpreted this part wrongly.  He says Ezra Karger has already vetted this aspect.","Relevant expertise

Policy stream considerations
This paper is being evaluated as part of our Policy/Applied stream, and thus it’s not being directly compared to academic research. See our sketch of this stream here.

COI considerations
I believe Matt is in a fairly important position at Open Philanthropy; he runs the Innovation Policy program.  OP is a  large funder of relevant research. We might try to find evaluators less likely to apply to OP for funding, and we might encourage them to remain anonymous. This might be a less substantial consideration for a traditional academic.","22 Feb 2024: Matt has been positive and helpful. We’ve had a detailed conversation, and we are following up. He has made several suggestions, reflected above.

The author will engage with us (including perhaps by finding ways to condense their work and answering evaluator queries)
This is among the most influential and strongest work on this general topic.
DR: Moving this forward but noting challenges here. 
We might consider
Classing it as part of our ‘non-academic stream’; it could be hard for evaluators to consider ‘what tier journal would/should publish this’
We may want to ask Matt to condense/clean up content if possible
Because of the length and scope, we might ask evaluators to limit their evaluation to certain sections/issues
Comments moved from Airtable version
DR Noted we’ve spoken to Matt Clancy a bit.
 I fleshed out some of the content here (see above). We have some definite ideas about who/what/how/why to evaluate this. Next I hope to read the paper itself in more detail. But let’s push on with this once you have the bandwidth.

Joel: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?
What question needs to be asked by when?
There's a lot of information scattered in different emails, pages, messages, comments. Can we stick to one single communication channel, e.g. only by email or only in this comment thread?
DR: Joel Christoph “lot of information” → happy to discuss this only in the boxes above
DR: 
What does success look like as an evaluator of this paper?” Joel Christoph I’m not sure if you are asking a broad or a narrow question here. I discuss this on our page here in a general sense. For the ’policy stream’, the main goals are the first and third ones mentioned there.

“Crafting evaluations and ratings that help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research. For Research Users.”

“Providing constructive feedback to Authors”

In the boxes above, I raise some specific issues I would like evaluators to consider above, and Matt also raised some

What question needs to be asked by when?
Not sure what you are asking here.  We give the evaluators autonomy. However, we do make recommendations.I guess that’s what we need to decide now. Which questions should evaluators tackle, and how should we  divide this between the evaluators. Of course that depends on the expertise and interests of the evaluators we manage to get.. 
Joel and David had a face to face chat on this. 
JC noted:
1. I share your concerns about the length and formatting potentially deterring our evaluators. Let's narrow our focus further or ask Matt to streamline the document to clearly delineate the sections for each evaluator and highlight the essential parts our focus.
2. I note that we are evaluating this paper to help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research AND to provide constructive feedback to the author.

DR: Joel Christoph I moved this paper back to ‘awaiting author update’ based on the recent response from Matt Clancy, until we hear from him or decide to move forward
On March Matt proposed a delay “a month or two” for some updates (proposed on May 8, not sure how long the delay is).  Checkin date April 25?
Update 25 April — Matt promised a new version would be up in 2 weeks.

Update May 9 — Matt shared a new version. Joel Christoph let’s move forward on this.

It doesn’t cite the Athey surrogate method, which David Rhys Bernard has investigated for estimating long-term effects.

In considering “the evaluator’s focus”, maybe we should identify some theories of change, e.g., 
“knowing the extent of pivot penalties, and where they are more or less strong, could guide future research funding and incentives in future crises, as well as understanding how much we can rely on pivoting in future crises and how much we need to build pre-crisis research infrastructure” … possibly relevant to GCRs.
